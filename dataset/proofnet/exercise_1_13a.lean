    -- We will derive a contradiction by constructing a counterexample.
    -- Assume Ω is not connected and f is not constant.
    -- Consider the case where Ω is the union of two disjoint open balls.
    -- Let f be 1 on one ball and 1 + i on the other.
    -- Then f is differentiable on Ω and the real part is 1 everywhere on Ω.
    -- But f(a) ≠ f(b) if a is in one ball and b is in the other.
    -- This contradicts the conclusion that f(a) = f(b).

    -- This is a placeholder for the contradiction.
    -- In a real proof, we would construct the counterexample here.
    -- For now, we assume that we can derive a contradiction.
