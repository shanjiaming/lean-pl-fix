S'_n = sum_{i=0 to n-1} 1/(a_0···a_i) = ... 
```

But `a_0···a_i = a₁···a_i` (`a₀ =1`), and recall `a₁···a_n = product_{k=1 to n} (b_k +2)/b_{k-1}`. 

This bring `a₁···a_n = (b₁ +2)/b₀ · (b₂ +2)/b₁ ··· (b_n +2)/b_{n-1}` (`b_0 =1`) telescopes to `(b_n +2)/b₀ · 1/(b_k)` for intermediate. 

No: it’s `(b_n +2)·1/(b_0 =1) · prod_{k=1 to n-1} 1/b_k`. 

=> `a₁···a_n = (b_n +2) · prod_{k=1 to n-1} (1/b_k)`. 

However, `a₁···a_n = (b_n +2) · prod_{k=1 to n-1} (1/b_k) does not seem quite right, as `a₁ a₂` is `(b₁ + 2)·(b₂ +2)/b₁` (`n=2`), which is `(b₂ +2)·(b₁ +2)/b₁`. 

So, for `n` terms (`a₁ {to a_n`), it is `a₁···a_n` is not `(b_n +2)/(b_{n-1}···)`, 

but rather, for `S'`, the sum `sum_{i=0 to n-1} 1/(a_0···a_i)` is `sum_{i=0 to n-1} 1/(a₁···a_{i)`), (`a₀ =1`). 

Case `i =0`, product is empty (`=1`), `i=1` is `1/a₁ = 1/(b₁ +2)`.

`i=2`, `1/(a₁ a₂)` is `b₁/( (b₁ +2)(b₂ +2))`.

`i=3`, `1/(a₁ a₂ a₃)` is `b₁ b₂` over `(b₁ +2)(b₂ +2)(b₃ +2)`, etc. 

This can be written as a telescopic sum. 

Define `v_n` as `b_1 · b_{n-1} / ( (b₁ +2)··· (b_n +2) )` (for `n ≥1`), and `v₀ =1` corresponds to `i=0` (`1/a₀··· =1`).

Then, we have recurrence relations (`relate `v_{n}` to `v_{n-1}`). 

Indeed:
`v_n = v_{n-1} · b_{n}/(b_{n} +2) ↔` because from `v_{n-1}`, it previously had `1/(b_{n-1} +2)` at the last place`, but now has `b_{n-1}/(b_{n-1} +2)) ·1/(b_n +2)` when going to `v_n`.

Ah, no. 

Actually, recall that `1/(a₁···a_n)` is `1/ [(b₁ +2)/b₀···(b_n +2)/b_{n-1}]` (`b₀ =1`), so `= b₀···b_{n-1} /( (b₁ +2)···(b_n +2)))` (`b₀ =1`), so is `b₁···b_{n-1}/( (b₁ +2)···(b_n +2))`. 

But, define `v_n` as the `1/(a₁···a_n)` term (`n ≥1`), and `v_0 =1` (`i=0`). 

Then the sum `S'_n` is `v_0 + v₁ +···+ v_{n-1}` (`i=0` to `n-1`). 

Get a recurrence for `v_n`: 

`v_n` is `b₁···b_{n-1}/( (b₁+2)··· (b_n +2)`. 

Similarly `v_{n-1}` is `b₁···b_{n-2}/ ( (b₁ +2) ... (b_{n-1} +2))`. 

Thus, we have the ratio (`n ≥1`): 

`v_n/v_{n-1} = (b_{n-1} (b_{n-1} +2))/(b_n +2)` (`(n=1` `v₁/v₀` needs special case). 

But `v₀ =1`, `v₁ = 1/(a₁ )` (`i=1`, `v₁ =1/(a₁) = b₀/(b₁ +2) = 1/(b₁ +2)`. 

`v₂ = 1/(a₁ a₂) = b₁/((b₁ +2)(b₂ +2))`. 

Thus, we have `v_1 = 1/(b₁ + 2)`, `v_2 = b₁/((b₁ +2)(b₂ +2)) = (b₁/(b₁ +2)) ·1/(b₂ +2)`. 

But `b₂ +2 = b₁ a₂` (`b₂ = b₁ a₂ -2`). 

Thus, `v₂ = (b₁ a₂)^{-1} b₁/(b₁ +2) = 1/(a₂) · v₁`. 

But `a₂` is `(b₂ +2)/b₁`, or `(b₂ +2)`調` (1/b₁)`.

Thus `v₂ = v₁/(a₂) = (v₁ b₁)/(b₂ +2)` (`a₂ = (b₂ +2)/b₁`). 

Thus `v₂ = (v₁ b₁)/(b₂ +2)`.

Similarly, inductively, we find some recursive relation for `v_n`.

However, the key is that `v_n/v_{n-1} = b_{n-1}/(b_n +2) (`n ≥2`). 

Thus (`n ≥2`),` v_n = v_{n-1} · b_{n-1}/(b_n +2)`.

However, we can also rewrite `b_n +2 = b_{n-1} a_n`, so `v_n = v_{n-1} · b_{n-1}/(b_{n-1} a_n) = v_{n-1}/a_n`. 

But `v_{n-1}` for `n =2` is `v₁ =1/(b₁ + 2)`, while `v₂ = v₁ · (b₁)/(b₂ +2) = (using `b₂ +2 = b₁ a₂`) `v₁ · 1/a₂`. 

Thus, `v_n = v_{n-1}/a_n` (`n ≥2`). 

Hence `v_n` is rather small, given that `a_n > 2/B` (`a_n` should be `≈3`). 

Thus, `S'_n` grows by `v_n` for `n` each time. But `v_n` is not obvious. 

Recap: for `n ≥2`, `v_n = v_{n-1}/a_n`, whereas `v_0 =1`, `v₁ =1/(b₁ +2)` (`= 1/a₁`), whichmatches `v₁ = v_0 /a₁`,n` provided we define `a_0 =1`. 

Thus `v_n = v_{n-1}/a_n` (`n ≥1`). 

But `v_{n-1}` is `1/(a₁···a_{n-1} )` (`n ≥1`), so `v_n` is `1/(a₁···a_n)`. 

Using `v_n = 1/(a₁···a_n)`, we have `S'_n` is (`1` is `v₀ =1`) plus `sum_{i=1 to n-1} v_i`, where `v_i` is `1/(a₁···a_i)`. 

But `v_i = 1/(a₁···a_i)`, and the sum (`S'`) is geometrically `sum v_i`. 

We wish to show that, under some dynamics (`b_n` bounded), we have `S'_n → 3/2`. 

Alternatively, perhaps the `v_i` sum, `v₀ + v₁ +···` telescopes. 

Indeed, look at `v_0 =1`, `v₁ = 1/a₁`, `v₂ = 1/(a₁ a₂)`,… so `v_i` are decreasing (`a_i` >1 as `a₁ > 2`). 

However, if indeed `b_n` → `1`, then `a_n` →3, and `v_i` would be `~ 1/3^i`, so the sum `S' = sum v_i →1 +1/3 +… = 3/2`. 

But we need to establish `b_n →1`. 

We know that (`a_n = (b_n +2)/b_{n-1}`), `a_n > 2/B` (`B` upper bound of `b_n`), possibly `a_n` can grow. 

But can `b_n` do anything (wildly oscillate)? 

Remember that `a_n > 2/b_{n-1} >0`, but also `b_n = b_{n-1} a_n -2`, is几何关系. 

Suppose `b_{n} < 1`: then `a_{n+1} = (b_{n+1} + 2)/b_n`, and `b_{n+1} = b_n a_{n+1} - 2`. Thus `a_{n+1}` is related to `b_{n}`, but `b_{n+1}` will become `≥ if `a_{n+1}` is large. Now, `a_{n+1} > 2/b_n`, so minimal `a_{n+1} > 2/b_n`, so `b_{n+1} > b_n (2/b_n) - 2 = 0`. 

Thus, perhaps `b_n` is always `> 0.5` is bounded below. 

From `a_n = (b_n + 2)/b_{n-1}` and `b_n >0`, have `b_n = b_{n-1} a_n -2`. Assume `b_n ≤ B` (`∀n`), we can bound `a_n = (b_n +2)/b_{n-1} ≤ B/b_{n-1} + 2/b_{n-1}`: large if `b_{n-1}` is small. 

Alternatively, `a_{n+1} = (b_{n+1) +2)/b_n`, and `b_{n+1} = b_n a_{n+1} -2` (`b_{n+1} +2 = b_n a_{n+1}`). 

Divide these (`a_{n+1}` and `a_n` interleaving): 

`a_{n+1}/a_n = ( (b_{n+1} +2)/b_n ) (b_{n-1} / (b_n +2)) = ( (b_n a_{n+1} )/b_n ) (b_{n-1} / (b_n +2)) = a_{n+1} (b_{n-1})/(b_n +2)`, hence `a_{n+1}/a_n = a_{n+1} · (b_{n-1})/(b_n +2)`. 

Divide both sides by `a_{n+1}` (`>0`): `1/a_n = (b_{n-1})/(b_n +2)`. 

This `1/a_n = b_{n-1}/(b_n +2)` is `b_{n-1} / (b_n +2)` (`n ≥1`).

Substitute `n` to `n+1`:` 1/a_{n+1} = b_n / (b_{n+1} +2)`.

Thus, we get `1/a_n = b_{n-1}/ (b_n +2`).

But `v_n = 1/(a₁···a_n)` (`n ≥0`), we have recurrence `v_{n+1} = v_n /a_{n+1}` (`n ≥0`), `v₀ =1`)

Now, but `1/a_n = b_{n-1}/(b_n +2)` (`n ≥1`). 

So `v_1 =1/a₁ = 1/(b₁ +2)` (`as `b₀ =1`, our earlier `n ≥1`), correct. 

`v_2 = v₁/a₂ = v₁ · b₁/(b₂ +2) = (1/(b₁ +2)) (b₁/(b₂ +2)` (`n=1`:`1/a₁ =1/(b₁ +2)), `n=2`:`1/a₂ =b₁/(b₂ +2`), as expected. 

We can check these manually to ensure correctness. 

So, knowing`/a_n = b_{n-1}/(b_n +2)`, can we find `v_n` explicitly?

`v_n` is `product (b_{k-1} / (b_k +2))` for `k =1` to `n` (``n ≥1``). 

`v_n = 1/(a₁···a_n) = product_{k=1 to n} (b_{k-1}/(b_k +2))`, with `b₀ =1` (`a₀ =1`). 

Thus, `v_n = b₀/(b₁ +2) · b₁/(b₂ +2) ··· b_{n-1}/(b_n +2)`.  Telescoping product is

`v_n = b₀ b₁…b_{n-1} / ( (b₁ +2)(b₂ +2)…(b_n +2))` cancels partially (`b1…b_{n-1}`) to give:

`v_n = 1 (b₀) / [ (b_n +2) product_{k=1 to n-1} ((b_k +2)/b_k)) ]`. 

Not obvious how telescope further.

But also, recall that `S'_n = v_0 + v₁ +… + v_{n-1}`, and we hoped `S'_n →3/2`. 

Can relate via

`v_n = `frac{b_{n-1}}{b_n +2}v_{n-1}` (from earlier `v_n =v_{n-1} b_{n-1}/(b_n +2)`). 

But `b_n +2 ` is `b_{n-1} a_n`, we know.

Thus `v_n = v_{n-1} (1/(a_n))`, as we already have (`n ≥1`). 

Somehow want `v_n` (`n`) to be decreasing to base case. 

Alternatively, use `v_n`'s  form in terms of `b's`Expressing  :

`v_n = b₀···b_{n-1} /( (b₁ +2)···(b_n +2))`. 

Then, if assume as `n →∞`, `b_n →b` (some `1?`), then `b ≤ B`, `b > 0` (`b_n >0`). 

But the limit:需要 `b` must satisfy. 

Given `b_n >0` and bounded (`≤B`), let `b_{n_k}` a convergent subsequence (`→b`). 

Then, `b_{n_k -1} a_{n_k} -2 = b_{n_k}`,取 limit `a_{n_k} = (b_{n_k} +2)/b_{n_k -1}`. If `b_{n_k -1}` also converges to`` b
