The hypothesis `hS` defines `S i j` as `∑' a : ℕ, ∑' b : ℕ, if a * (i.1 + 1) + b * (j.1 + 1) = (n : ℤ) then 1 else 0`. This is the number of nonnegative integer solutions `(a, b)` to `a * (i + 1) + b * (j + 1) = n` (`i.1` is the value of `i : Fin n`, so `i.1 + 1` is `i + 1` in the problem statement, but `i` is `0`-based in Lean).

But the problem statement's matrix is `S i j` (`i, j` from `1` to `n`) is the number of solutions to `a i + b j = n`. So Lean's `S i j` is the problem's `S (i + 1) (j + 1)`.

But the determinant formula is not matching. For `n = 5`, Lean's `S` is `5 × 5` with determinant `0`, but the formula gives `6`.

But the problem statement's matrix for `n = 5` is:
```
6 3 2 2 2
3 0 1 0 1
2 1 0 0 1
2 0 0 0 1
2 1 1 1 2
