Here, `m` and `n` are `>` (asumptions), and `A` is `Matrix (Fin m) (Fin n) ℚ`. 

The condition `mpos` is `0 < m` and `0 < n`, so `m > 0`, `n > 0`. For example, `m = 1` and `n = 1` is allowed. 

But then, `encard S ≥ m + n` is `encard S ≥ 2` (`m + n = 1 + 1 = 2`). 

Wait, but for a `1 × 1` matrix (`m = n = 1`), `A` just has `A 0 0`, `A : Fin 1 → Fin 1 → ℚ`. 

How many primes exist in `S`?

The set `S` is `{p : Nat | p.Prime ∧ ∃ (i j), |A i j| = p}`. For matrix `A`, letting `a = A 0 0`, we have `S = {p | p.Prime ∧ |a| = p}`. 

Thus, `S = ∅` if `|a|` is not a prime (`a` is not `± a prime`) the rational), or `S = {p}` if `|a| = p` (`a = ± p`, `p` prime). 

But `S` is either `∅` or `{p}` (some `p`), `S` has `encard S` either `0` or `1`. 

But hypothésis is `encard S ≥ m + n = 2`. 

However, Lean uses `Infinity` (`ENNReal` includes `∞`). If `S` is infinite, `encard S = ∞` (`≥ m + n = 2`). 

But `S` finite is `≤ m * n`. 

However, is it possible that `S` is infinite? 

This would mean that `{p : Nat | p.Prime ∧ |a| = p}` is infinite. 

But `a` is fixed (`a : ℚ`, `|a|` is fixed rational number). 

The set `{p  Nat | p.Prime and (p : ℚ) = |a|}` is either `{}` (if `|a|` is not a natural number prime) or `{p}` (`p` is the prime if `|a| = p`). 

For example, only `p = 2` is possible when `a = ± 2`. 

But Lean normalizes rational numbers (`± 2` is `(2 : ℚ) = (2 : ℚ) / 1` `(-2 : ℚ) = (-2 : ℚ) / 1`, or something). 

Thus, `S` is either empty or singleton `{p}` (`p` prime). 

In no case can `S` have `encard S ≥ 2` (`m + n ≥ 2` if `m = n = 1`) unless `m + n ≤ 0`, impossible (`m, n > 0`). 

But `S` is `{p | p.Prime ∧ |a| = p}`, and `encard S` is `0` (`if no p`), `1` (if `p` exists), or `> 1` is impossible. 

**Conclusion**: The theorem is vacuously true when `m = n = 1` because `encard S ≥ 2` cannot hold (`S` has at most `1` prime, `encard S ≤ 1 < 2`). 

Similarly, if `m` or `n` is `1`:

For `m = 1` ( `n ≥ 1`), the max possible `encard S` is `m * n = n` (`n ≥ 1` is arbitrary). 

The assumption is `encard S ≥ m + n = 1 + n`, so the theorem's assumptions require `n ≥ 1 + n` (`n` being `m * n ≥ m + n`, with `m = 1` this `n ≥ 1 + n`, `0 ≥ 1`, only possible if `n = 0`). 

But `n > 0` is assumed (`mnpos`), so `n > 0`. 

But `n ≥ 1 + n` has no solution (`n : ℕ`). 

Thus, the theorem's assumption `encard S ≥ m + n` is impossible to satisfy! 

Because `S.card ≤ m * n`, and `m * n < m + n` whenever `m = 1` or `n = 1`. 

If neither `m` nor `n` are `1`, then `m * n ≥ m + n` (`(m ≥ 2`, n ≥ 2`), because `m, n ≥ 1` and `(m - 1)(n - 1) ≥ 1`). 

Thus, the only way `encard S ≥ m + n` (`S.card ≤ m * n`) is if `m * n ≥ m + n`). 

This happens if `m ≥ 2` and `n ≥ 2`, or `m = 1` and `n ≥ 1` (but `m + n`不会出現). 

But `m * n - (m + n) = (m - 1)(n - 1), and if `m ≥ 2` or `n ≥ 2`, can `m * n ≥ m + n`? 

For `m = 2` (`n = 3`), `m * n = 6`, `m + n = 5`, `6 ≥ 5` (True). 

But when `m = 1`, `m * n = n`, `m + n = 1 + n`. Then `n ≥ 1 + n` is `n ≥ n + 1`, `0 ≥ 1` is false (`n : ℕ`). 

Thus, the `if` statement `encard S ≥ m + n` (`S` at most `m * n`) is always false for `m = 1` (`n > 0` because `npos : n > 0`). 

Hence, the assumptions can never be satisfied! 

**Intermediate Conclusion**: The theorem is vacuously true if `m = 1` (`encard S ≥ 1 + n` cannot happen because `S.card ≤ n * 1` contradicting `n ≥ 1 + n`). 

Analogously for `n = 1` (`encard S ≥ m + 1`, `S.card ≤ m * 1`, so `m * 1 ≥ m + 1` is `m ≥ m + 1`, `0 ≥ 1` is impossible, because `m > 0`). 

Thus, `m ≥ 2` and `n ≥ 2` is the only case when `m * n ≥ m + n` is possible (`m = n = 2` gives `4 ≥ 4`), and `encard S ≥ m + n` is potentially possible (`S.card ≤ m * n ≥ m + n`). 

But if `m = 2`, `n = 3`, then `m * n = 6 ≥ m + n = 5`. The assumption `encard S ≥ m + n = 5` (`S.card ≤ 6`); is possible, but it's not clear immediately that `S` can have size `5` (`S` collects all `p` appearing in any entry as `± p`). 

But we can construct `A` (if `m = 2`, `n = 3`):
```
A = [ 2 3 5 ]
    [ 7 11 13 ]
