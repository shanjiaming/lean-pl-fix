theorem h1  : false = true := by
  have h2 : ∃ (k : ℝ), exactly_two_minima k := by sorry
  obtain ⟨k, hk⟩ := h2
  obtain ⟨a, b, ha, hb, hab, hfab, hmin⟩ := hk
  have h3 := hmin a ha
  have h4 : f k a > f k a ∨ a = b := by simpa using h3
  cases h4 with
  | inl h4 => linarith
  | inr h4 => contradiction
