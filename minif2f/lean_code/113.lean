theorem amc12a_2009_p2 : 1 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (1 + 1)) = (5 : ℚ) / 3 := by
  -- The goal is to simplify the left-hand side (LHS) expression and show it equals 5/3
  -- We'll proceed step by step, simplifying the nested fractions from the innermost part outward

  -- Step 1: Simplify the innermost denominator (1 + 1) to 2
  have step1 : 1 + 1 = 2 := by norm_num
  -- norm_num is a tactic that proves equalities involving numerical calculations

  -- Step 2: Replace (1 + 1) in the original expression with 2
  rw [step1]
  -- Now the expression becomes: 1 + 1 / (1 + 1 / 2)

  -- Step 3: Simplify the next denominator (1 + 1/2)
  have step2 : 1 + 1 / 2 = 3 / 2 := by
    -- We need to show 1 + 1/2 = 3/2
    -- First convert 1 to rational 1/1
    rw [←Rat.div_one 1]
    -- Now we have 1/1 + 1/2
    -- Find common denominator and add fractions
    rw [Rat.add_def' 1 1 1 2]
    -- Simplify numerator and denominator
    norm_num
    -- This proves 1 + 1/2 = 3/2

  -- Step 4: Replace (1 + 1/2) in the expression with 3/2
  rw [step2]
  -- Now the expression becomes: 1 + 1 / (3/2)

  -- Step 5: Simplify 1 / (3/2) to 2/3 (division by fraction is multiplication by reciprocal)
  have step3 : 1 / (3 / 2) = 2 / 3 := by
    -- Division of fractions is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal
    rw [Rat.div_def]
    -- Simplify the multiplication
    norm_num
    -- This proves 1 / (3/2) = 2/3

  -- Step 6: Replace 1 / (3/2) in the expression with 2/3
  rw [step3]
  -- Now the expression becomes: 1 + 2/3

  -- Step 7: Simplify the final addition
  have step4 : 1 + 2 / 3 = 5 / 3 := by
    -- Convert 1 to rational 3/3
    rw [←Rat.div_one 3, ←Rat.div_self (by norm_num : (3 : ℚ) ≠ 0)]
    -- Now we have 3/3 + 2/3
    -- Add fractions with common denominator
    rw [Rat.add_def' 3 2 3 3]
    -- Simplify numerator and denominator
    norm_num
    -- This proves 1 + 2/3 = 5/3

  -- Step 8: Replace 1 + 2/3 with 5/3
  rw [step4]
  -- Now the goal is simply 5/3 = 5/3, which is true by reflexivity

  -- The proof is complete
