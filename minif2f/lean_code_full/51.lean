Tim is doing a cakewalk with $11$ steps. He takes his first step on step $1$ and takes a total of 
139 steps, walking in a circle (so that after the 11th step he reaches the first step again). 
Which step of the cakewalk does he end on? Show that it is 7.

Mathematical explanation:
- The cakewalk has 11 steps, so it's equivalent to arithmetic modulo 11.
- Starting at step 1, taking 139 steps means we need to compute (1 + 139) mod 11.
- However, since the first step is already on position 1, we can think of it as adding 138 steps.
- Equivalently, we can compute 139 mod 11 directly to find the offset from the starting position.
- 11 × 12 = 132, and 139 - 132 = 7, so 139 mod 11 = 7.
