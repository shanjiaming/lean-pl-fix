Find the remainder of 2^8 when it is divided by 5. Show that it is 1.
This is a straightforward computation, but we'll prove it using modular arithmetic properties.

  -- First approach: Direct computation
  -- We could simply compute 2^8 = 256 and then 256 % 5 = 1
  -- But let's prove it more formally using properties of exponents and moduli

  -- Step 1: Rewrite 2^8 as (2^4)^2 to simplify the computation
  have h1 : 2^8 = (2^4)^2 := by rw [‚Üê pow_mul, mul_comm, pow_mul]
  
  -- Step 2: Compute 2^4 = 16
  have h2 : 2^4 = 16 := by norm_num
  
  -- Step 3: Compute 16 mod 5 = 1 (since 16 = 3*5 + 1)
  have h3 : 16 % 5 = 1 := by norm_num
  
  -- Step 4: Substitute back to show (2^4)^2 mod 5 = 16^2 mod 5
  have h4 : (2^4)^2 % 5 = 16^2 % 5 := by rw [h2]
  
  -- Step 5: Use the property that (a mod m)^n mod m = a^n mod m
  -- So 16^2 mod 5 = (16 mod 5)^2 mod 5 = 1^2 mod 5 = 1 mod 5
  have h5 : 16^2 % 5 = (16 % 5)^2 % 5 := by rw [pow_mod]
  
  -- Step 6: Substitute h3 into h5
  have h6 : (16 % 5)^2 % 5 = 1^2 % 5 := by rw [h3]
  
  -- Step 7: Compute 1^2 % 5 = 1
  have h7 : 1^2 % 5 = 1 := by norm_num
  
  -- Step 8: Chain all the equalities together
  rw [h1, h4, h5, h6, h7]
  
  -- Alternative one-line proof using norm_num which can handle this computation directly
