Simplify (2-2i)(5+5i), where i² = -1. Show that it is 20.
We'll prove this by:
1. Expanding the product using the distributive property
2. Simplifying terms involving i using i² = -1
3. Combining like terms to reach the final result of 20

  -- First, substitute the given definitions of q and e into the goal

  -- Now we need to expand (2 - 2*I)*(5 + 5*I)
  -- We'll use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand this product
  -- (a + b)*(c + d) = a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d

  -- After expansion, we have terms with I² which we know equals -1
  -- The current expression is: 10 + 10*I - 10*I - 10*I²
  -- The 10*I and -10*I terms cancel out, leaving 10 - 10*I²
  -- Since I² = -1, this becomes 10 - 10*(-1) = 10 + 10 = 20
  
  -- The 'ring' tactic can handle all these simplifications automatically
  -- It knows that I² = -1 and can perform arithmetic simplification
