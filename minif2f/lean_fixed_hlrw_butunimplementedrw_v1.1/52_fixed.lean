  -- Our goal is to prove that the distance from (x,y) to the origin is 11
  -- The distance formula gives us √(x² + y²), so we need to show x² + y² = 121
  
  -- First, let's compute x² + y² using the identity:
  -- x² + y² = (x + y)² - 2xy
  have key_identity : x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2 * (x * y) := by
    -- Expand (x + y)² and simplify
    calc (x + y)^2 - 2 * (x * y) 
        = x^2 + 2*x*y + y^2 - 2*x*y := by ring
      _ = x^2 + y^2 := by ring
  
  -- Now substitute our known values from hypotheses h₀ and h₁
  have sum_of_squares : x^2 + y^2 = 13^2 - 2 * 24 := by

  have final_eq : x^2 + y^2 = 121 := by

  -- Now take square roots of both sides
  -- Since distance is always non-negative and 11 is positive, we can conclude
