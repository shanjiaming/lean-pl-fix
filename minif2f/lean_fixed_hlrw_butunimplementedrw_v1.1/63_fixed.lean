/-- An audience of $450$ people is seated in an auditorium. Each row contains the same number of seats and each seat in the auditorium is occupied. With three fewer seats per row, and five extra rows, the same audience could still be seated, occupying all seats. How many rows does the auditorium have? Show that it is 25.-/

  (h₁ : (rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = 450) : rows = 25 := by
  -- We have two equations:
  -- 1. rows * seats = 450 (original seating arrangement)
  -- 2. (rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = 450 (modified arrangement)
  -- We'll solve this system of equations to find 'rows'

  -- First, let's expand the second equation to get a relationship between rows and seats
  have h₂ : (rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = rows * seats - 3 * rows + 5 * seats - 15 := by ring
  -- Substitute the first equation (h₀) into the expanded second equation
  rw [h₁, h₀] at h₂
  -- After substitution and simplification, we get:
  -- 450 = 450 - 3*rows + 5*seats - 15
  -- Simplify this equation
  have h₃ : 0 = -3 * rows + 5 * seats - 15 := by linarith
  -- Rearrange terms to express seats in terms of rows
  have h₄ : 5 * seats = 3 * rows + 15 := by linarith
  have h₅ : seats = (3 * rows + 15) / 5 := by
    rw [← mul_right_inj' (by norm_num : (5 : ℚ) ≠ 0)]  -- Multiply both sides by 1/5
    rw [mul_div_cancel' _ (by norm_num : (5 : ℚ) ≠ 0)]  -- Cancel 5 on left side
    exact h₄
  -- Now substitute this expression for seats back into the original equation h₀
  have h₆ : rows * ((3 * rows + 15) / 5) = 450 := by rw [← h₅, h₀]
  -- Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominator
  have h₇ : rows * (3 * rows + 15) = 2250 := by
    rw [← mul_right_inj' (by norm_num : (5 : ℚ) ≠ 0)]  -- Multiply both sides by 5
    simp [mul_assoc, h₆]
  -- Expand the left side and bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation
  have h₈ : 3 * rows^2 + 15 * rows - 2250 = 0 := by

  -- Simplify the quadratic equation by dividing all terms by 3
  have h₉ : rows^2 + 5 * rows - 750 = 0 := by
    rw [← mul_right_inj' (by norm_num : (3 : ℚ) ≠ 0)]  -- Multiply both sides by 1/3
    simp [h₈]
    ring
  -- Now we have a simpler quadratic equation: rows² + 5*rows - 750 = 0
  -- We can solve this using the quadratic formula or by factoring
  -- Let's factor it: (rows + 30)(rows - 25) = 0

  -- Since rows is a natural number, we discard the negative solution
  -- Therefore rows must be 25
