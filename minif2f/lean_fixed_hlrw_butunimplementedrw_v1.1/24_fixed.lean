/-- Let $f$ be a function satisfying $f(xy) = \frac{f(x)}y$ for all positive real numbers $x$ and $y$. 
If $f(500) =3$, what is the value of $f(600)$?

$(\mathrm{A})\ 1 \qquad (\mathrm{B})\ 2 \qquad (\mathrm{C})\ \frac52 \qquad (\mathrm{D})\ 3 \qquad (\mathrm{E})\ \frac{18}5$ 
Show that it is \textbf{C } \frac52.-/

  -- First, we'll find a general form for f(x) using the functional equation
  -- Let's consider x = 1 in the functional equation to get f(y) = f(1)/y for any y > 0
  -- This suggests f has the form f(x) = C/x where C is a constant
