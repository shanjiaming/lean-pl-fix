  -- However, for the sake of this problem, we can just verify that x = 26 works:
  -- Let's assume y = 2 and verify:

  -- Now substitute y = 2 back into the original equation:
  have : x + 2 + x * 2 = 80 := by rwa [y_eq] at h₂
  -- Simplify:
  have : 3 * x + 2 = 80 := by ring_nf at this; exact this
  -- Solve for x:
  have : 3 * x = 78 := by linarith
  have : x = 26 := by linarith
  
  -- Therefore, x must be 26
