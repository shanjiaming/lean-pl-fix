/-- Which of the following is equal to $1 + \frac {1}{1 + \frac {1}{1 + 1}}$?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac {5}{4} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac {3}{2} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac {5}{3} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 2 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 3$ Show that it is \text{C}.-/
theorem amc12a_2009_p2 : 1 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (1 + 1)) = (5 : â„š) / 3 := by
  -- The goal is to simplify the left-hand side (LHS) expression and show it equals 5/3
  -- We'll proceed step by step, simplifying the nested fractions from the innermost part outward

  -- Step 1: Simplify the innermost denominator (1 + 1) to 2
  have step1 : 1 + 1 = 2 := by norm_num
  -- norm_num is a tactic that proves equalities involving numerical calculations

  -- Step 2: Replace (1 + 1) in the original expression with 2
  norm_num
  -- Now the expression becomes: 1 + 1 / (1 + 1 / 2)

  -- Step 3: Simplify the next denominator (1 + 1/2)
