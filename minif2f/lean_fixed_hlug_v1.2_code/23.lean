/-- Find an integer $n$ such that $0\leq n<398$ and $n$ is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398. Show that it is 57.-/
theorem mathd_numbertheory_33 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n < 398) (h₁ : n * 7 % 398 = 1) : n = 57 := by
  -- We need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 398, i.e., a number n such that 7*n ≡ 1 mod 398
  -- This is equivalent to finding integers n and k such that 7n = 398k + 1
  -- We can solve this using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity

  -- First, we'll compute gcd(7, 398) using the Euclidean algorithm to verify that an inverse exists
