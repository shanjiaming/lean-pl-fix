  -- First, observe that the inequality is symmetric in a, b, c except for sign changes
  -- The left-hand side expression is cyclic and anti-symmetric
  
  -- Strategy: 
  -- 1. Normalize by setting a² + b² + c² = 1 to simplify the right-hand side
  -- 2. Use symmetry to assume without loss of generality that a ≥ b ≥ c
  -- 3. Express the inequality in terms of two variables after eliminating one using the constraint
  -- 4. Find maximum of the resulting expression

  -- If a² + b² + c² = 0, then a = b = c = 0 and inequality holds trivially

  -- Otherwise, we can divide both sides by (a² + b² + c²)^2 and set a² + b² + c² = 1
  -- Let x = a/√(a²+b²+c²), y = b/√(a²+b²+c²), z = c/√(a²+b²+c²)
  -- Then x² + y² + z² = 1 and the inequality becomes:

    x * y * (x^2 - y^2) + y * z * (y^2 - z^2) + z * x * (z^2 - x^2) ≤ 9 * Real.sqrt 2 / 32 := by
    -- Step 2: By symmetry, we can assume x ≥ y ≥ z
    -- The LHS is anti-symmetric, so the maximum absolute value occurs when x ≥ y ≥ z
    
    -- Step 3: Express in terms of two variables using x² + y² + z² = 1
    -- Let's parameterize using spherical coordinates or look for critical points
    
    -- After some calculation (outside Lean), we find the maximum occurs when:
    -- z = 0, x² + y² = 1, and the expression becomes x*y*(x²-y²)
    -- To maximize this under x² + y² = 1, set x = cos θ, y = sin θ
    -- The expression becomes cos θ * sin θ * (cos² θ - sin² θ) = 1/2 sin(2θ) * cos(2θ) = 1/4 sin(4θ)
    -- The maximum of sin(4θ) is 1, so maximum value is 1/4
    
    -- However, we need to compare this with our target (9√2)/32 ≈ 0.397 < 0.25
    -- This suggests our initial approach needs refinement
    
    -- Alternative approach: The original inequality is tight when (a,b,c) = (1,1/2,0) up to scaling
    -- Let's verify this case:
    -- For (1,1/2,0), LHS = 1*(1/2)*(1-1/4) = 3/8 ≈ 0.375
    -- RHS = (9√2)/32 * (1 + 1/4 + 0)^2 = (9√2)/32 * (25/16) ≈ 0.397 * 1.5625 ≈ 0.62
    -- This doesn't match, so perhaps the maximum is higher
    
    -- After more careful analysis, the maximum actually occurs when two variables are equal
    -- and the third is a specific ratio. For example, when a = b and c = -a/2
    
    -- For the purpose of this formalization, we'll use the following strategy:
    -- 1. Express the LHS as a polynomial in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials
    -- 2. Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum under the constraint x²+y²+z²=1
    
    -- The LHS can be rewritten as:
    -- (x + y + z)(x - y)(y - z)(z - x)
    
    -- This is a well-known identity for the Vandermonde-like expression
    
    -- Now we need to maximize |(x+y+z)(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)| under x²+y²+z²=1
    
    -- Using symmetry and calculus, the maximum occurs when:
    -- Two variables are equal (say y = z) and the third is in a specific ratio
    
    -- Let's set y = z and maximize under x² + 2y² = 1
    -- The expression becomes (x + 2y)(x - y)(y - x)(y - y) = (x + 2y)(x - y)(-1)(x - y)*0 = 0
    -- This gives zero, which is not the maximum
    
    -- Instead, the maximum occurs when one variable is zero (say z = 0)
    -- Then the expression becomes (x + y)(x - y)(y)(-x) = -xy(x² - y²)
    -- Under x² + y² = 1, we need to maximize |xy(x² - y²)|
    
    -- Let x = cos θ, y = sin θ
    -- Then |xy(x² - y²)| = |cos θ sin θ (cos² θ - sin² θ)| = |1/2 sin(2θ) cos(2θ)| = |1/4 sin(4θ)|
    -- The maximum is 1/4
    
    -- Now compare with the right side: 9√2/32 ≈ 0.397 > 1/4 = 0.25
    -- So the inequality holds
    
    -- Therefore, the maximum value of the LHS under normalization is 1/4
    -- And we have 1/4 ≤ 9√2/32 because 8 ≤ 9√2 (since √2 ≈ 1.414 → 9√2 ≈ 12.72)
    
    -- To verify numerically: 1/4 = 0.25 ≤ 9√2/32 ≈ 0.397
    
    -- Thus the inequality holds in the normalized case
    
    -- For a formal proof, we would need to:
    -- 1. Prove that the maximum of |(x+y+z)(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)| under x²+y²+z²=1 is indeed 1/4
    -- 2. Show that 1/4 ≤ 9√2/32
