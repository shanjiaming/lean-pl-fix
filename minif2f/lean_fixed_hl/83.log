Let f be an injective function from {1,2,3,...} to itself. Prove that for any n we have:
∑_{k=1}^n f(k)/k² ≥ ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k.

The proof uses rearrangement inequality ideas, showing that the minimal sum occurs when f(k) = k.

Let f be an injective function from {1,2,3,...} to itself. Prove that for any n we have:
∑_{k=1}^n f(k)/k² ≥ ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k.

The proof uses rearrangement inequality ideas, showing that the minimal sum occurs when f(k) = k.
