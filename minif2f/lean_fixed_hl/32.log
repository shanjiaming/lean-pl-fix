One dimension of a cube is increased by 1, another is decreased by 1, and the third is left unchanged. 
The volume of the new rectangular solid is 5 less than that of the cube. What was the volume of the cube?

Options:
(A) 8 (B) 27 (C) 64 (D) 125 (E) 216 

We will prove that the correct answer is (D) 125.
