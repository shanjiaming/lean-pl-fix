/-- Let $f$ be a [[function]] for which $f\left(\dfrac{x}{3}\right) = x^2 + x + 1$. Find the sum of all values of $z$ for which $f(3z) = 7$.

  -- First, we'll find the explicit form of f by making a substitution
  -- Let y = x/3, then x = 3y, so f(y) = (3y)^2 + 3y + 1 = 9y² + 3y + 1
  have f_explicit : ∀ y, f y = 9 * y ^ 2 + 3 * y + 1 := by

    simp at this
    rw [mul_div_cancel] at this
    exact this
    -- 3y is divisible by 3, so the division is valid

  -- Now we need to find all z such that f(3z) = 7
  -- Using our explicit form of f:
  -- f(3z) = 9(3z)² + 3(3z) + 1 = 81z² + 9z + 1 = 7
  -- So we have the quadratic equation: 81z² + 9z - 6 = 0
  -- Simplified: 27z² + 3z - 2 = 0

  -- We'll first show that the preimage of 7 under f is exactly the roots of this quadratic
  have preimage_eq_roots : f ⁻¹' {7} = {z | 27 * z ^ 2 + 3 * z - 2 = 0} := by

  -- Since the preimage is finite (by h₁), we know the quadratic has exactly two roots
  -- We'll now calculate the sum of these roots using Vieta's formula
  -- For a quadratic az² + bz + c = 0, sum of roots is -b/a

  -- First, we'll show that the quadratic is indeed the one we're interested in
  have quadratic_roots : ∀ z, z ∈ (f ⁻¹' {7}).toFinset ↔ 27 * z ^ 2 + 3 * z - 2 = 0 := by

  -- The problem asks for the sum of y/3 where y = 3z (since we're looking at f(3z) = 7)
  -- But actually, from the problem statement, we need the sum of z values where f(3z) = 7
  -- Which is exactly what we have in roots_sum

  -- However, the theorem statement asks for ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7
  -- So we need to relate this to our previous calculation
  -- Let's make the substitution y = 3z, then z = y/3
  -- The sum becomes ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7

  -- From roots_sum, we know ∑ z = -1/9 where z satisfies f(3z) = 7
  -- But we need ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7
  -- So we can rewrite:
  have final_sum : ∑ y in (f ⁻¹' {7}).toFinset, y / 3 = (∑ y in (f ⁻¹' {7}).toFinset, y) / 3 := by
    simp only [Finset.sum_div]

  -- Now combine with our previous result
  rw [final_sum]
  -- We know ∑ y = -1/9 from roots_sum (after appropriate substitution)
  -- So the final result is (-1/9)/3 = -1/27
  -- Wait, this contradicts the theorem statement - need to re-examine

  -- Actually, the theorem statement might be different from our interpretation
  -- Let's re-examine the problem statement:
  -- "Find the sum of all values of z for which f(3z) = 7"
  -- So we need ∑ z where f(3z) = 7, which is -1/9 from Vieta's formula

  -- But the theorem is stated as ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7
  -- These are actually equivalent because:
  -- {z | f(3z) = 7} = {y/3 | f(y) = 7}
  -- So ∑ z = ∑ (y/3) = -1/9

  -- Therefore, the theorem statement is correct
  -- We can now complete the proof
