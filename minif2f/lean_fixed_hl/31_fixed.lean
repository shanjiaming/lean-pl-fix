/-- What is the remainder of 2004 divided by 12? Show that it is 0.-/
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 : 2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  -- To prove that 2004 mod 12 equals 0, we need to show that 12 divides 2004 exactly
  -- First approach: Direct computation by factoring both numbers
  
  -- Step 1: Factorize 2004 into its prime components
  have h2004 : 2004 = 12 * 167 := by norm_num
  -- This shows 2004 = 12 Ã— 167, which means 2004 is exactly divisible by 12
  
  -- Step 2: Rewrite the original goal using the factorization
  rw [h2004]
  -- Now the goal becomes (12 * 167) % 12 = 0
  
  -- Step 3: Apply the modulus multiplication rule
  -- The property (a * b) % a = 0 holds for any positive integer b
  rw [mul_comm, Nat.mul_mod_left]
  -- mul_comm swaps the multiplication order to (167 * 12) % 12
  -- Nat.mul_mod_left simplifies this to 0 since any multiple of 12 mod 12 is 0
  
  -- Alternative approach using the definition of modulus:
  -- The modulus a % b is the remainder after division of a by b
  -- Since we've shown 2004 = 12 * 167 + 0, the remainder must be 0
  
  -- No further goals remain, so the proof is complete
