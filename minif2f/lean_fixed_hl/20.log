/-- How many natural numbers less than 1000 have exactly three distinct positive integer divisors? Show that it is 11.-/

  -- The key observation is that numbers with exactly three divisors must be squares of primes.
  -- This is because:
  -- - For a number n with prime factorization n = Π p_i^e_i, the number of divisors is Π (e_i + 1)
  -- - To get exactly 3 divisors, the exponents must be (2) (since 3 is prime, there can only be one prime factor)
  -- - Therefore n must be p^2 where p is prime, giving divisors {1, p, p^2}

  -- First, we'll find all prime squares less than 1000
  -- The largest prime whose square is less than 1000 is 31, since 31^2 = 961 < 1000 and 37^2 = 1369 > 1000

  -- Define the set of primes whose squares are less than 1000
  let primes_less_than_32 := Finset.filter (fun p => p.Prime) (Finset.range 32)
