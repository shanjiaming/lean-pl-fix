  -- First, we'll find the slope (a) of the line using the two given points
  -- From h₀, we know f is a linear function of form f(x) = a*x + b
  -- We have two equations from the given points:
  -- 1) f(7) = a*7 + b = 4 (from h₁)
  -- 2) f(6) = a*6 + b = 3 (from h₂)
  
  -- Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate b and find a:
  -- (a*7 + b) - (a*6 + b) = 4 - 3 → a = 1
  have h₃ : a = 1 := by

  -- Now that we know a = 1, we can find b using one of the equations

  -- Now we have the complete function: f(x) = 1*x - 3
  -- To find the x-intercept, we solve f(x) = 0
  -- 1*x - 3 = 0 → x = 3
  -- Therefore, f(3) should be 0
  -- Let's verify this:
