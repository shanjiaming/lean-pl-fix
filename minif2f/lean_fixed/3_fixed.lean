What is the volume of a cube whose surface area is twice that of a cube with volume 1? 

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \sqrt{2}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 2\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 2\sqrt{2}\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 4\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 8$ 
Show that it is \mathrm{(C)}.

Proof outline:
1. Let y be the side length of the original cube (volume = 1)
2. Compute y from the volume equation y³ = 1
3. Compute the surface area of original cube: 6y²
4. The new cube has surface area twice this: 2*(6y²) = 12y²
5. Let x be the side length of the new cube
6. Set up equation for new cube's surface area: 6x² = 12y²
7. Solve for x in terms of y
8. Compute volume of new cube: x³
9. Show this equals 2√2
