/-- What is the result when the greatest common factor of 6432 and 132 is increased by 11? Show that it is 23.-/
theorem mathd_numbertheory_45 : Nat.gcd 6432 132 + 11 = 23 := by
  -- To prove this, we need to compute gcd(6432, 132) and show it equals 12
  -- Then adding 11 gives us 23 as required

  -- First, simplify both numbers by factoring out common powers of 2
  -- 6432 ÷ 4 = 1608, 132 ÷ 4 = 33, so gcd(6432,132) = 4 × gcd(1608,33)
  have h₁ : Nat.gcd 6432 132 = 4 * Nat.gcd 1608 33 := by
    rw [← Nat.gcd_mul_left 6432 4 33]  -- Factor out 4 from both numbers
    simp only [mul_left_inj' (by norm_num : 4 ≠ 0)]  -- Simplify multiplication
    rw [show 4 * 1608 = 6432 by rfl, show 4 * 33 = 132 by rfl]  -- Verify factorization

  -- Now compute gcd(1608,33) using Euclidean algorithm:
  -- 1608 = 48 × 33 + 24
  -- gcd(33,24) = gcd(24,9) = gcd(9,6) = gcd(6,3) = gcd(3,0) = 3
  have h₂ : Nat.gcd 1608 33 = 3 := by
    rw [Nat.gcd_rec]  -- Apply Euclidean algorithm step
    rw [show 1608 % 33 = 24 by rfl]  -- 1608 ÷ 33 = 48 remainder 24
    rw [Nat.gcd_rec, show 33 % 24 = 9 by rfl]  -- Next step: gcd(33,24)
    rw [Nat.gcd_rec, show 24 % 9 = 6 by rfl]   -- Next step: gcd(24,9)
    rw [Nat.gcd_rec, show 9 % 6 = 3 by rfl]    -- Next step: gcd(9,6)
    rw [Nat.gcd_rec, show 6 % 3 = 0 by rfl]    -- Final step: gcd(6,3)
    rfl  -- gcd(3,0) = 3

  -- Combine the results: gcd(6432,132) = 4 × 3 = 12
  rw [h₁, h₂]
