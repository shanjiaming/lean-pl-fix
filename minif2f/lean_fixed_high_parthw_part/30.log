  -- "Find the sum of all values of z for which f(3z) = 7"
  -- So we need ∑ z where f(3z) = 7, which is -1/9 from Vieta's formula

  -- But the theorem is stated as ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7
  -- These are actually equivalent because:
  -- {z | f(3z) = 7} = {y/3 | f(y) = 7}
  -- So ∑ z = ∑ (y/3) = -1/9

  -- Therefore, the theorem statement is correct

  -- The problem asks for the sum of y/3 where y = 3z (since we're looking at f(3z) = 7)
  -- But actually, from the problem statement, we need the sum of z values where f(3z) = 7
  -- Which is exactly what we have in roots_sum

  -- However, the theorem statement asks for ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7
  -- So we need to relate this to our previous calculation
  -- Let's make the substitution y = 3z, then z = y/3
  -- The sum becomes ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7

  -- From roots_sum, we know ∑ z = -1/9 where z satisfies f(3z) = 7
  -- But we need ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7
  -- So we can rewrite:
  have final_sum : ∑ y in (f ⁻¹' {7}).toFinset, y / 3 = (∑ y in (f ⁻¹' {7}).toFinset, y) / 3 := by
    simp only [Finset.sum_div]

  -- Now combine with our previous result
  rw [final_sum]
  -- We know ∑ y = -1/9 from roots_sum (after appropriate substitution)
  -- So the final result is (-1/9)/3 = -1/27
  -- Wait, this contradicts the theorem statement - need to re-examine

  -- Actually, the theorem statement might be different from our interpretation
  -- Let's re-examine the problem statement:
  -- "Find the sum of all values of z for which f(3z) = 7"
  -- So we need ∑ z where f(3z) = 7, which is -1/9 from Vieta's formula

  -- But the theorem is stated as ∑ (y / 3) where f(y) = 7
  -- These are actually equivalent because:
  -- {z | f(3z) = 7} = {y/3 | f(y) = 7}
  -- So ∑ z = ∑ (y/3) = -1/9

  -- Therefore, the theorem statement is correct
  -- We can now complete the proof
