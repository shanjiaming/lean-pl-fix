/-- Determine the remainder of 71 (mod 3). Show that it is 2.-/
theorem mathd_numbertheory_81 : 71 % 3 = 2 := by
  -- To prove that 71 modulo 3 equals 2, we can proceed in several ways:
  -- 1. Direct computation by finding the largest multiple of 3 ≤ 71
  -- 2. Using properties of modular arithmetic
  -- 3. Using the norm_num tactic which can evaluate concrete arithmetic expressions

  -- Method 1: Direct computation
  -- First, we compute the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 71
  -- 3 × 23 = 69, and 3 × 24 = 72 which is > 71
  -- Therefore 71 - 69 = 2, so 71 % 3 = 2

  -- Method 2: Using modular arithmetic properties
  -- We can break down 71 into parts whose modulo we know:
  -- 71 = 70 + 1
  -- 70 % 3 = (7 × 10) % 3 = (7 % 3 × 10 % 3) % 3 = (1 × 1) % 3 = 1
  -- 1 % 3 = 1
  -- So 71 % 3 = (1 + 1) % 3 = 2

  -- In Lean, we can use the norm_num tactic which is designed to
  -- evaluate concrete arithmetic expressions including modulo operations
  norm_num

  -- The norm_num tactic automatically performs the necessary computation
  -- to verify that 71 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2
  -- This completes the proof
