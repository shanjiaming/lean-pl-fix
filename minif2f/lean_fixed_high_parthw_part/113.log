  -- The goal is to simplify the left-hand side (LHS) expression and show it equals 5/3

  -- Step 2: Replace (1 + 1) in the original expression with 2

    rw [Rat.add_def' 1 1 1 2]

    norm_num
    -- This proves 1 + 1/2 = 3/2

  -- Step 4: Replace (1 + 1/2) in the expression with 3/2
  rw [step2]
  -- Now the expression becomes: 1 + 1 / (3/2)

  -- Step 5: Simplify 1 / (3/2) to 2/3 (division by fraction is multiplication by reciprocal)

  -- Step 6: Replace 1 / (3/2) in the expression with 2/3
