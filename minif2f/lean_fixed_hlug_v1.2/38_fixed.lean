  -- First, let's unpack the given information:
  -- σ is an equivalence (bijection) on ℝ, representing our function f and its inverse
  -- h₀ states that the forward function σ.1 (f) is defined by f(x) = 5x - 12
  -- h₁ states the condition that f(x+1) = f⁻¹(x)
  
  -- We'll start by finding an explicit expression for the inverse function σ.2 (f⁻¹)
  -- Since f is bijective, we can solve y = 5x - 12 for x to find the inverse
  have inverse_expr : ∀ y, σ.2 y = (y + 12) / 5 := by
    intro y
    -- The inverse should satisfy f(f⁻¹(y)) = y
    -- So we solve 5x - 12 = y for x:
    -- 5x = y + 12
    -- x = (y + 12)/5
    -- Since σ is an Equiv, σ.2 is indeed the inverse, so this must hold
    apply σ.injective

  -- Now we can rewrite the condition h₁ using our expressions for f and f⁻¹
  -- h₁ states: f(x+1) = f⁻¹(x)
  -- Using h₀ and inverse_expr:
  rw [h₀, inverse_expr] at h₁
  
  -- Now we have: 5(x+1) - 12 = (x + 12)/5
  -- Let's simplify the left side:
  -- 5x + 5 - 12 = (x + 12)/5
  -- 5x - 7 = (x + 12)/5
  -- Now multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominator:
  have step1 : 5 * (5 * x - 7) = x + 12 := by
    linarith
  have step2 : 24 * x = 47 := by

  -- Divide both sides by 24 to isolate x
