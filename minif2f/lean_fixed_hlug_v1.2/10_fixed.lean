  -- Strategy: We'll evaluate f at specific points to get equations about a, b, c
  -- First, evaluate f at x = -3 (which makes x+3 = 0) using both expressions
  
  -- Using h₀ with x = -3 gives f(0) = 3*(-3)^2 + 7*(-3) + 4
  have f0 : f 0 = 3 * (-3)^2 + 7 * (-3) + 4 := h₀ (-3)
  -- Simplify the right hand side
  have f0_simplified : f 0 = 3*9 - 21 + 4 := by ring_nf at f0 ⊢; exact f0
  have f0_final : f 0 = 10 := by linarith
  
  -- Using h₁ with x = 0 gives f(0) = a*0^2 + b*0 + c = c
  have c_eq : c = f 0 := by rw [h₁ 0]; ring
  -- Therefore c = 10
  have c_value : c = 10 := by rw [c_eq, f0_final]
  
  -- Next, evaluate f at x = -2 (which makes x+3 = 1) using both expressions
  
  -- Using h₀ with x = -2 gives f(1) = 3*(-2)^2 + 7*(-2) + 4
  have f1 : f 1 = 3 * (-2)^2 + 7 * (-2) + 4 := h₀ (-2)
  -- Simplify the right hand side
  have f1_simplified : f 1 = 3*4 - 14 + 4 := by ring_nf at f1 ⊢; exact f1
  have f1_final : f 1 = 2 := by linarith
  
  -- Using h₁ with x = 1 gives f(1) = a*1^2 + b*1 + c = a + b + c
  have abc_eq : a + b + c = f 1 := by rw [h₁ 1]; ring
  -- But we already know c = 10, so a + b + 10 = 2
