/-- What is the [[reciprocal]] of $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}$?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{6}{7}\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{7}{6}\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ \frac{5}{3}\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 3\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \frac{7}{2}$ Show that it is \frac{6}{7}.-/
theorem amc12a_2008_p2 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x * (1 / 2 + 2 / 3) = 1) : x = 6 / 7 := by
  -- Our goal is to solve for x in the equation x * (1/2 + 2/3) = 1
  -- First, we'll simplify the expression inside the parentheses
  
  -- Step 1: Compute the sum of fractions 1/2 + 2/3
  -- To add fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case
  have h₁ : (1 / 2 : ℝ) + (2 / 3) = 7 / 6 := by
    -- Convert both fractions to have denominator 6
    -- 1/2 = 3/6 and 2/3 = 4/6
    rw [div_add_div]
    -- Simplify the numerators: 1*3 + 2*2 = 3 + 4 = 7
    simp only [one_mul, mul_one]
    -- The denominator becomes 2*3 = 6
    norm_num
    -- Now we have 7/6
  
  -- Step 2: Substitute the simplified sum back into the original equation
  rw [h₁] at h₀
  -- Now h₀ becomes: x * (7/6) = 1
  
  -- Step 3: Solve for x by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of 7/6
  -- The reciprocal of 7/6 is 6/7
  -- Multiply both sides of the equation by 6/7:
  have h₂ : x = 1 * (6 / 7) := by
    -- We can use the property that a * b = 1 implies a = 1/b when b ≠ 0
    -- First, show that 7/6 ≠ 0 (which it clearly isn't)
    have h₃ : (7 / 6 : ℝ) ≠ 0 := by norm_num
    -- Now apply the property to solve for x
    exact (eq_mul_inv_iff_mul_eq₀ h₃).mp h₀
  
  -- Step 4: Simplify the right-hand side
  -- 1 * (6/7) simplifies to 6/7
  simp only [one_mul] at h₂
  
  -- Step 5: Our goal now exactly matches h₂
  exact h₂
