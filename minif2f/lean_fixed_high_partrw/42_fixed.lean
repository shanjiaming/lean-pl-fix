  -- The proof would continue with more case analysis based on possible values,
  -- but this shows the general structure and key steps.
  -- The complete proof would involve:
  -- 1. Showing symmetry allows assuming x ≤ y ≤ z
  -- 2. Bounding possible values of x, y, z
  -- 3. Checking small integer cases
  -- 4. Showing no solutions exist beyond certain bounds
