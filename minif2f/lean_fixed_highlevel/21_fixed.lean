/-- What is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $30x \equiv 42 \pmod{47}$? Show that it is 39.-/

  -- To prove that 39 is the least natural number satisfying the congruence,
  -- we need to show two things:
  -- 1. 39 satisfies the congruence (30 * 39 ≡ 42 mod 47)
  -- 2. Any natural number x < 39 does not satisfy the congruence

  -- First, let's prove that 39 satisfies the congruence

    -- 30 * 39 = 1170
    -- 47 * 24 = 1128

    -- So 1170 ≡ 42 mod 47

  -- Now we need to show that any smaller natural number doesn't satisfy the congruence
  -- We'll first find the general solution to the congruence equation
  -- The equation 30x ≡ 42 mod 47 is equivalent to finding the multiplicative inverse of 30 modulo 47

  -- Since 47 is prime and 30 is not divisible by 47, 30 has an inverse modulo 47

    -- 1638 - 1598 = 40
    -- But we expect 39, so there must be a miscalculation
    -- Let me re-express this:
    -- We know 30 * 39 ≡ 42 mod 47
    -- Multiply both sides by 39:
    -- 30 * 39 * 39 ≡ 42 * 39 mod 47
    -- But 30 * 39 ≡ 1 mod 47, so:
