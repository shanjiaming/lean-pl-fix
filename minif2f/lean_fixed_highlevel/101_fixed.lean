/-- What is the $x$-coordinate for the $x$-intercept of the line containing the points $(7,4)$ and $(6,3)$? Show that it is 3.-/
theorem mathd_algebra_43 (a b : ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = a * x + b) (h₁ : f 7 = 4)
  (h₂ : f 6 = 3) : f 3 = 0 := by
  -- First, we'll find the slope (a) of the line using the two given points
  -- From h₀, we know f is a linear function of form f(x) = a*x + b
  -- We have two equations from the given points:
  -- 1) f(7) = a*7 + b = 4 (from h₁)
  -- 2) f(6) = a*6 + b = 3 (from h₂)
  
  -- Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate b and find a:
  -- (a*7 + b) - (a*6 + b) = 4 - 3 → a = 1
  have h₃ : a = 1 := by
    -- Apply the function definition to both points
    rw [h₀] at h₁ h₂
    -- Now h₁: a*7 + b = 4, h₂: a*6 + b = 3
    -- Subtract h₂ from h₁ to eliminate b
    linear_combination h₁ - h₂
  
  -- Now that we know a = 1, we can find b using one of the equations
  -- Using h₂: 1*6 + b = 3 → b = -3
  have h₄ : b = -3 := by
    -- Substitute a = 1 into h₂
    rw [h₃, h₀] at h₂
    -- Now h₂: 1*6 + b = 3 → 6 + b = 3
    linarith
  
  -- Now we have the complete function: f(x) = 1*x - 3
  -- To find the x-intercept, we solve f(x) = 0
  -- 1*x - 3 = 0 → x = 3
  -- Therefore, f(3) should be 0
  -- Let's verify this:
  rw [h₀, h₃, h₄]  -- Substitute a = 1 and b = -3 into the function definition
  -- Now the goal is 1*3 - 3 = 0
  norm_num  -- Simplifies the arithmetic to 0 = 0
