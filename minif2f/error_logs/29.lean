Simplify (9 - 4i) - (-3 - 4i). Show that it is 12.
This theorem proves that the difference between two complex numbers q and e equals 12,
where q is defined as 9 - 4i and e is defined as -3 - 4i.

theorem mathd_algebra_48 (q e : ℂ) (h₀ : q = 9 - 4 * Complex.I) (h₁ : e = -3 - 4 * Complex.I) :
  q - e = 12 := by
  -- First, we substitute the definitions of q and e from the hypotheses
  rw [h₀, h₁]  -- Rewrites q and e using their definitions in h₀ and h₁
  -- Now the goal becomes: (9 - 4*I) - (-3 - 4*I) = 12
  
  -- Next, we simplify the subtraction of complex numbers
  -- We distribute the subtraction operation
  simp only [sub_eq_add_neg]  -- Converts subtraction to addition of negative
  -- Goal becomes: (9 - 4*I) + -(-3 - 4*I) = 12
  
  -- Simplify the negation of the second complex number
  simp only [neg_sub]  -- Applies the property -(a - b) = -a + b
  -- Goal becomes: (9 - 4*I) + (3 + 4*I) = 12
  
  -- Now we remove the parentheses and regroup terms
  simp only [add_sub]  -- Distributes the addition over subtraction
  -- Goal becomes: 9 - 4*I + 3 + 4*I = 12
  
  -- Combine like terms (real parts and imaginary parts)
  ring  -- The 'ring' tactic solves goals in commutative rings by normalization
  -- This successfully simplifies the left side to 12, matching the right side
  
  -- No more goals left, so the proof is complete
