theorem h₁₀ (a b c : ℕ) (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9) (h₁ : 1 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 9) (h₂ : 1 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 9) (h₃ : a ≠ b) (h₄ : a ≠ c) (h₅ : b ≠ c) (h₆ : a + b = c) (h₇ : 10 * a + a - b = 2 * c) (h₈ : c * b = 10 * a + a + a) (h₉ : b = 3 * a) : a ≤ 3 := by
  have h₁₀₁ : b ≤ 9 := h₁.2
  have h₁₀₂ : b = 3 * a := h₉
  have h₁₀₃ : 3 * a ≤ 9 := by sorry
  have h₁₀₄ : a ≤ 3 := by sorry
  exact h₁₀₄
