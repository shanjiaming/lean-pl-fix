However, the variables `p`, `q`, `s`, `g` are defined inside the `let` statement and are not constrained to have any relation to `f`. The actual goal is to prove three things with these definitions of `p`, `q`, `s`, `g`:
1. A specific condition on `f(n+1, x)` in terms of `p` and `q`.
2. That `s` is the set of `x` for which `f(n, x)` has a limit. But `s` is explicitly defined as `{x | x ≥ 0}`, so this seems false unless we assume `s = {x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}` is forced, which it isn't. However, the statement says `s = {x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}` must be proved, which is a direct consequence of the definition of `s` in the `let` statement only if `{x | x ≥ 0} = {x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}`. 

But clearly, the statement is not correctly capturing the problem, because `s` cannot be both `{x | x ≥ 0}` and `{x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}` simultaneously unless we know that `f(n, x)` has a limit iff `x ≥ 0`. 

However, nowhere in the statement are `u` and `v` constrained beyond their definitions in terms of binomial coefficients. The actual `f(n, x)` is not provided in the Lean code, only `hu`, `hv`, and `hf` are given as assumptions. 

But in the problem, we are given:
- `f(x, n) = (Sum_{k=0:2:n} (n choose k) x^{k/2}) / (Sum_{k=1:2:n} (n choose k) x^{(k-1)/2} )`

But in the Lean code, `u n x = Sum_{i=0}^{n/2} (n choose (2i)) x^i`, and `v n x = Sum_{i=0}^{(n-1)/2} (n choose (2i+1)) x^i`.

Thus, comparing:
- `Sum_{k=0:2:n}` becomes `Sum_{i=0}^{n/2} (n choose (2i)) x^i` (so `k = 2i`).
- Denominator: `Sum_{k=1:2:n} (n choose k) x^{(k-1)/2}`. Here, if `k` is odd (`k = 2i + 1`), then `(k-1)/2 = i`, so the denominator becomes `Sum_{i=0}^{(n-1)/2} (n choose (2i+1)) x^i`.

But in `f(x, n)` in the problem, `f(0)` would have denominator zero (`n > 0` is avoided in Lean). The Lean theorem also uses `n > 0`.

The statement is very strange because it is given a random `p, q, s, g` unrelated to `f`, and asks to prove things that are unlikely to be true unless `f` is constructed to make them true. 

But in the Lean problem, `f` is not actually defined; instead, `hu`, `hv`, `hf` are hypotheses, but there is no guarantee that such functions exist. However, the Lean theorem is stated as:
```
theorem putnam_1965_b4
    (f u v : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ)
    (hu : ∀ n > 0, ∀ x, u n x = ...)
    (hv : ...)
    (hf : ...)
    (n : ℕ)
    (hn : 0 < n) :
    ... :=
```    

#### Understanding the Lean Theorem Statement
The statement constructs `p, q, s, g` and proves that given the hypotheses on `u, v, f`:
1. The first goal: Under some non-zero conditions, `f(n+1, x) = p(f n) x / q(f n) x`. 
   But `p(f n) x = f n x + x`, and `q(f n) x = f n x + 1`. So it claims:
   `f(n+1, x) = (f(n, x) + x)/(f(n, x) + 1)` under the given conditions.

   This seems plausible if we can derive a recurrence between `f(n+1, x)` and `f(n, x)`.

2. `s` is claimed to be `{x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}`, but in the `let` statement it is defined as the set `{x | x ≥ 0}`. So unless `s` is trivially equal to the set of all `x` (if `f(n, x)` always has a limit), this seems restrictive. 
   But since we're letting `s = {x | x ≥ 0}`, we are required to prove that `s = {x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}`. 

   However, the hypotheses don't tell us anything about `f` (beyond `f = u/v`), so we would have to prove that `{x | x ≥ 0} = {x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}`. 

   This would mean that:
   - For `x ≥ 0`, `f(n, x)` has a limit.
   - For `x < 0`, `f(n, x)` does not have a limit.

   But this is not necessarily true given that `u` and `v` are arbitrary sums, unless we can derive a closed form for `f(n, x)` (e.g., using binomial identities).

   However, the actual problem seems to imply a specific form of `f(n,x)`: 
   - `f(x, n) = ((1 + √x)^n + (1 - √x)^n)/ ((1 + √x)^n - (1 - √x)^n)`.

3. The third goal says that for `x ∈ s`, `f(n,x)` tends to `g(x) = √x`. 
   But `x ∈ s` would mean `x ≥ 0`. 

   The actual problem has the limit as `1/√x` if `x > 1`, but `√x` if `x < 1`. For `x = 1`, `f(n, 1)` should tend to `1`.

   Thus, the statement in Lean is incorrect unless `g(x)` is defined differently or additional hypotheses are added.

But on closer inspection, the actual problem is:
```
Let f(x, n) = (Sum_{even k} (n choose k) x^{k/2}) / (Sum_{odd k} (n choose k) x^{(k-1)/2}). 
Find lim_{n→∞} f(x, n) for x where it exists.
```

But `f(x, n)` does not seem to make sense, because if we have `x^{k/2}`, then for `k=4`, `x^{k/2} = x²`, and for `k=6`, it's `x³`, but denominator has `k=3` gives `x^{(k-1)/2} = x¹`, `k=5` gives `x²`, etc.

Notably, for `n=1`:
- `f(x, 1) = (1 choose 0)/(1 choose 1) = 1/1 = 1`.
For `n=2`:
- `f(x, 2) = ((2 choose 0) + (2 choose 2) x)/((2 choose 1)) = (1 + x)/2`.
For `n=3`:
- `f(x, 3) = ((3 choose 0) + (3 choose 2) x)/((3 choose 1) + (3 choose 3) x) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.

This matches the Lean definition:
- `u n x`: Sum over `i` from `0` to `n/2`, `(n choose 2i) x^i`.
- `v n x`: Sum over `i` from `0` to `(n-1)/2` (`= floor((n-1)/2)`), `(n choose (2i + 1)) x^i`.

Thus:
- `u 1 x = (1 choose 0) x^0 = 1`.
- `v 1 x = (1 choose 1) x^0 = 1`.
- `f(1, x) = 1/1 = 1`.
- `u 2 x = (2 choose 0) x^0 + (2 choose 2) x^1 = 1 + x`.
- `v 2 x = (2 choose 1) x^0 = 2`.
- `f(2, x) = (1 + x)/2`.
- `u 3 x = (3 choose 0) + (3 choose 2) x = 1 + 3 x`.
- `v 3 x = (3 choose 1) + (3 choose 3) x = 3 + x`.
- `f(3, x) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.

Now let's check `n=4`:
- `u 4 x = (4 choose 0) + (4 choose 2) x + (4 choose 4) x² = 1 + 6 x + x²`.
- `v 4 x = (4 choose 1) + (4 choose 3) x = 4 + 4 x`.
- `f(4, x) = (1 + 6 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x)`.

Now let's test the claim:
`f(n+1, x) = (f(n, x) + x)/(f(n, x) + 1)` for `n=1`:

`f(2, x) = (1 + x)/2`, and `(f(1, x) + x)/(f(1, x) + 1) = (1 + x)/(1 + 1) = (1 + x)/2 = f(2, x)`.

For `n=2`:
`f(3, x) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.
`(f(2, x) + x)/(f(2, x) + 1) = ((1 + x)/2 + x)/((1 + x)/2 + 1) = ((1 + x + 2 x)/2)/((1 + x + 2)/2) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.

For `n=3`:
`f(4, x) = (1 + 6 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x)`.
`(f(3, x) + x)/(f(3, x) + 1) = ((1 + 3 x)/(3 + x) + x)/((1 + 3 x)/(3 + x) + 1) = ((1 + 3 x + x(3 + x))/(3 + x)) / ((1 + 3 x + 3 + x)/(3 + x)) = (1 + 3 x + 3 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x) = (1 + 6 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x)`.

So `f(n+1, x)` is correctly given as `(f(n, x) + x)/(f(n, x) + 1)` under certain conditions. The Lean statement seems to have this as the first goal.

However, in the actual problem, the limit is:
```
lim_{n → ∞} f(n, x)
