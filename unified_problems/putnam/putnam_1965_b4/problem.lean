#### Understanding the Lean Theorem Statement
The statement constructs `p, q, s, g` and proves that given the hypotheses on `u, v, f`:
1. The first goal: Under some non-zero conditions, `f(n+1, x) = p(f n) x / q(f n) x`. 
   But `p(f n) x = f n x + x`, and `q(f n) x = f n x + 1`. So it claims:
   `f(n+1, x) = (f(n, x) + x)/(f(n, x) + 1)` under the given conditions.

   This seems plausible if we can derive a recurrence between `f(n+1, x)` and `f(n, x)`.

2. `s` is claimed to be `{x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}`, but in the `let` statement it is defined as the set `{x | x ≥ 0}`. So unless `s` is trivially equal to the set of all `x` (if `f(n, x)` always has a limit), this seems restrictive. 
   But since we're letting `s = {x | x ≥ 0}`, we are required to prove that `s = {x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}`. 

   However, the hypotheses don't tell us anything about `f` (beyond `f = u/v`), so we would have to prove that `{x | x ≥ 0} = {x | ∃ l, Tendsto ...}`. 

   This would mean that:
   - For `x ≥ 0`, `f(n, x)` has a limit.
   - For `x < 0`, `f(n, x)` does not have a limit.

   But this is not necessarily true given that `u` and `v` are arbitrary sums, unless we can derive a closed form for `f(n, x)` (e.g., using binomial identities).

   However, the actual problem seems to imply a specific form of `f(n,x)`: 
   - `f(x, n) = ((1 + √x)^n + (1 - √x)^n)/ ((1 + √x)^n - (1 - √x)^n)`.

3. The third goal says that for `x ∈ s`, `f(n,x)` tends to `g(x) = √x`. 
   But `x ∈ s` would mean `x ≥ 0`. 

   The actual problem has the limit as `1/√x` if `x > 1`, but `√x` if `x < 1`. For `x = 1`, `f(n, 1)` should tend to `1`.

   Thus, the statement in Lean is incorrect unless `g(x)` is defined differently or additional hypotheses are added.

But on closer inspection, the actual problem is:
```
Let f(x, n) = (Sum_{even k} (n choose k) x^{k/2}) / (Sum_{odd k} (n choose k) x^{(k-1)/2}). 
Find lim_{n→∞} f(x, n) for x where it exists.
```

But `f(x, n)` does not seem to make sense, because if we have `x^{k/2}`, then for `k=4`, `x^{k/2} = x²`, and for `k=6`, it's `x³`, but denominator has `k=3` gives `x^{(k-1)/2} = x¹`, `k=5` gives `x²`, etc.

Notably, for `n=1`:
- `f(x, 1) = (1 choose 0)/(1 choose 1) = 1/1 = 1`.
For `n=2`:
- `f(x, 2) = ((2 choose 0) + (2 choose 2) x)/((2 choose 1)) = (1 + x)/2`.
For `n=3`:
- `f(x, 3) = ((3 choose 0) + (3 choose 2) x)/((3 choose 1) + (3 choose 3) x) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.

This matches the Lean definition:
- `u n x`: Sum over `i` from `0` to `n/2`, `(n choose 2i) x^i`.
- `v n x`: Sum over `i` from `0` to `(n-1)/2` (`= floor((n-1)/2)`), `(n choose (2i + 1)) x^i`.

Thus:
- `u 1 x = (1 choose 0) x^0 = 1`.
- `v 1 x = (1 choose 1) x^0 = 1`.
- `f(1, x) = 1/1 = 1`.
- `u 2 x = (2 choose 0) x^0 + (2 choose 2) x^1 = 1 + x`.
- `v 2 x = (2 choose 1) x^0 = 2`.
- `f(2, x) = (1 + x)/2`.
- `u 3 x = (3 choose 0) + (3 choose 2) x = 1 + 3 x`.
- `v 3 x = (3 choose 1) + (3 choose 3) x = 3 + x`.
- `f(3, x) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.

Now let's check `n=4`:
- `u 4 x = (4 choose 0) + (4 choose 2) x + (4 choose 4) x² = 1 + 6 x + x²`.
- `v 4 x = (4 choose 1) + (4 choose 3) x = 4 + 4 x`.
- `f(4, x) = (1 + 6 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x)`.

Now let's test the claim:
`f(n+1, x) = (f(n, x) + x)/(f(n, x) + 1)` for `n=1`:

`f(2, x) = (1 + x)/2`, and `(f(1, x) + x)/(f(1, x) + 1) = (1 + x)/(1 + 1) = (1 + x)/2 = f(2, x)`.

For `n=2`:
`f(3, x) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.
`(f(2, x) + x)/(f(2, x) + 1) = ((1 + x)/2 + x)/((1 + x)/2 + 1) = ((1 + x + 2 x)/2)/((1 + x + 2)/2) = (1 + 3 x)/(3 + x)`.

For `n=3`:
`f(4, x) = (1 + 6 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x)`.
`(f(3, x) + x)/(f(3, x) + 1) = ((1 + 3 x)/(3 + x) + x)/((1 + 3 x)/(3 + x) + 1) = ((1 + 3 x + x(3 + x))/(3 + x)) / ((1 + 3 x + 3 + x)/(3 + x)) = (1 + 3 x + 3 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x) = (1 + 6 x + x²)/(4 + 4 x)`.

So `f(n+1, x)` is correctly given as `(f(n, x) + x)/(f(n, x) + 1)` under certain conditions. The Lean statement seems to have this as the first goal.

However, in the actual problem, the limit is:
```
lim_{n → ∞} f(n, x)
