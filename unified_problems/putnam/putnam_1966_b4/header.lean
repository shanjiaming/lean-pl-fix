Let $a_1, a_2, ...$ be an increasing sequence of $mn + 1$ positive integers. Prove that there exists either a subset of $m + 1$ $a_i$ such that no element of the subset divides any other, or a subset of $n + 1$ $a_i$ such that each element of the subset (except the greatest) divides the next greatest element.
