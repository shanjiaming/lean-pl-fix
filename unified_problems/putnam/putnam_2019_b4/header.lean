Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of functions $f(x,y)$ that are twice continuously differentiable for $x \geq 1,y \geq 1$ and that satisfy the following two equations (where subscripts denote partial derivatives):
\begin{gather*}
xf_x+yf_y=xy\ln(xy), \\
x^2f_{xx}+y^2f_{yy}=xy.
\end{gather*}
For each $f \in \mathcal{F}$, let $m(f)=\min_{s \geq 1} (f(s+1,s+1)-f(s+1,s)-f(s,s+1)+f(s,s))$. Determine $m(f)$, and show that it is independent of the choice of $f$.
