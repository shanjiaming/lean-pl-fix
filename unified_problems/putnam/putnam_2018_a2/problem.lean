But the conclusion is false unless `n = 1` because:
- For `n = 2`, `2^n - 1 = 3`. Define `S` as follows:
  - `S ⟨0, _⟩ = {1}`
  - `S ⟨1, _⟩ = {1}`
  - `S ⟨2, _⟩ = {2}`
  Then `Set.range S = {{1}, {2}}`, but `(Set.Icc 1 2).powerset \ {∅} = {{1}, {2}, {1, 2}}`, so `Set.range S ≠ (Set.Icc 1 2).powerset \ {∅}`. 

But `hS` requires that `Set.range S = (Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}`, so the above `S` is not allowed. 

But to satisfy `hS`, `S` must be surjective onto the nonempty subsets of `{1, ..., n}`. 

But if `n ≥ 2`, then `(Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}` has size `2^n - 1`, and `Fin (2^n - 1)` has `2^n - 1` elements, so `S` must be bijective (as a function onto `(Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}`) because it's surjective and the domain and codomain have the same cardinality. 

But in Lean, `Fin (2^n - 1)` is not the same as `(Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}` unless we have a bijection, but `hS` only requires that `Set.range S = (Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}`, which means that `S` is surjective, but not necessarily injective. 

But in Lean, `2^n - 1` is not the same as in math, because if `n = 0`, `2^n - 1 = 0`, but Lean uses natural numbers, and `n ≥ 1` is assumed, so `2^n - 1 ≥ 1`. 

But if `n ≥ 1`, then `(Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}` has cardinality `2^n - 1`, and `Fin (2^n - 1)` has `2^n - 1` elements, so `S` is surjective, and since the domain and codomain have the same finite cardinality, `S` is injective. 

But in Lean, `S : Fin (2^n - 1) → Set ℕ` is a function from `Fin (2^n - 1)` to `Set ℕ`, and `Set.range S` is `(Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}`, which is a finite set of cardinality `2^n - 1`. 

But `Fin (2^n - 1)` has `2^n - 1` elements, and `S` is surjective onto `(Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}`, so `S` is injective (because the domain and codomain have the same size). 

Thus, the assumption `hS` implies that `S` is bijective onto `(Set.Icc 1 n).powerset \ {∅}`. 

This means that the earlier concern about `S` not being injective is invalid because `hS` forces `S` to be injective (since the domain and codomain have the same finite size and `S` is surjective). 

But then the matrix `M` is correctly defined, and the problem is to compute its determinant. 

But the determinant is not `(if n = 1 then 1 else -1)` for `n ≥ 2`. 

For `n = 1`, the matrix is `[1]` with determinant `1`. 

For `n = 2`, the matrix is:
```
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
