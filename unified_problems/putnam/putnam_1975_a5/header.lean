On some interval $I$ of the real line, let $y_1(x), y_2(x)$ be linearly independent solutions of the differential equation \[y'' = f(x)y\], where $f(x)$ is a continuous real-valued function. Suppose that $y_1(x) > 0$ and $y_2(x) > 0$ on $I$. Show that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that, on $I$, the function \[z(x) = c \sqrt{y_1(x)y_2(x)}\] satisfies the equation \[z'' + 1/z^3 = f(x)z.\]
