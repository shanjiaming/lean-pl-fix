Suppose that $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are distinct points, no three of which lie on a line, in the Euclidean plane. Show that if the squares of the lengths of the line segments $AB$, $AC$, $AD$, $BC$, $BD$, and $CD$ are rational numbers, then the quotient $\frac{\text{area}(\triangle ABC)}{\text{area}(\triangle ABD)}$ is a rational number.
