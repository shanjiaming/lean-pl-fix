open Matrix

-- Note: This proof statement strays a bit from the problem statement since it manually checks a condition for acuteness based on side lengths.
/--
Let $d_1,d_2,\dots,d_{12}$ be real numbers in the open interval $(1,12)$. Show that there exist distinct indices $i,j,k$ such that $d_i,d_j,d_k$ are the side lengths of an acute triangle.
