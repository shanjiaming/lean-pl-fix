Let $A = [a_{ij}]$ be a $3 \times 3$ Markov transition matrix given by
  $$A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0.1 & 0.3 & 0.7 \\
  0.1 & 0.3 & 0.2 \\
  0.8 & 0.4 & 0.1
  \end{bmatrix}$$
  representing a random walk on three locations. If the initial state vector is $X_0 = [0, 1, 0]^T$, then the probability of being in the second location after three steps is given by the second component of the vector $X_3 = A^3 X_0$, which equals 0.18.
