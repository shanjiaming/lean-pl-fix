  -- Step 1: Express P(x) = f(x + 3.5) explicitly and simplify.
  have h₁ : f.eval (-3.5 + Real.sqrt (16 + Real.sqrt 151) / 2) = 0 ∧ f.eval (-3.5 - Real.sqrt (16 + Real.sqrt 151) / 2) = 0 ∧ f.eval (-3.5 + Real.sqrt (16 - Real.sqrt 151) / 2) = 0 ∧ f.eval (-3.5 - Real.sqrt (16 - Real.sqrt 151) / 2) = 0 := by sorry
  -- Step 2: Define S as the Finset of approximate real roots (using h₁ to ensure all are roots).
  -- Step 3: Verify the size of S is 4 (as roots are distinct).
  -- Step 4: Check that every x in S is a root with f.eval x = 0 (by h₁).
  -- Step 5: Check that if f.eval x = 0 then x ∈ S by exhaustively (using that polynomial has ≤ 4 real roots).
