For any number \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), all prime divisors of \(n^8-n^4+1\) are of the form \(24k+1\), \(k\in\mathbb{N}\), since any prime divisor \(p\) of \(n^8-n^4+1\) is congruent to 1 or 13 (mod 24) and since \[n^8-n^4+1=(n^4+n^2+1)-2(n^3+n)^2,\] 2 is a quadratic residue modulo \(p\), excluding the possibility \(p\equiv\pm13\) (mod 24).
