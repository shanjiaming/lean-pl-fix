⊢ ∑ k ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + (↑k + 1)) = 98 * u 0 + 4851

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

Make a precise decision based on the actual goal content changes.

Respond with exactly one of:
PRUNE - if this branch should be abandoned
CONTINUE - if this branch should be explored further

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

Make a precise decision based on the actual goal content changes.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_ring_rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2] - 1.  **Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?** No. Changing `1` to `↑1` (which is `((1 : ℕ) : Q)`) is a mere syntactic alteration and does not simplify or advance the proof.
2.  **Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?** The goal is not becoming simpler or more complex. It's becoming syntactically slightly different but effectively the same.
3.  **Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?** No. The change is neutral at best, and at worst, it suggests using a rewrite that is not designed for the current mathematical structure.
4.  **Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?** No. This tactic is not addressing the core mathematical problem of evaluating or manipulating the sum.

Given that the tactic made a non-substantive change that doesn't simplify or progress the proof, and likely indicates a random or unhelpful rewrite application, this branch should be pruned.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_rw[Nat.cast_eq_ofNat] - **Analysis of the change:**

*   **Before:** The right-hand side of the main goal's equality has a term `↑(∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (x + 1))`.
*   **After:**
    *   Goal 1: This term has been replaced by `OfNat.ofNat (∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (x + 1))`. This is an application of the `Nat.cast_eq_ofNat` lemma, which states `(n : α) = OfNat.ofNat n` when `α` has a `Nat.cast` instance and `OfNat n` instance, where `n` is a natural number. This essentially rephrases the natural number literal in terms of `OfNat.ofNat`.
    *   Goal 2: A side goal `(∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (x + 1)).AtLeastTwo` has been introduced. This is a condition for the lemma `Nat.cast_eq_ofNat` to apply, likely related to the definition of `OfNat.ofNat` for natural numbers greater than or equal to 2.

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Meaningful progress?** No. Replacing `↑n` with `OfNat.ofNat n` for a `Nat` `n` does not simplify the expression or bring it closer to the desired form. It's largely a definitional unrolling or rephrasing, which often complicates the term slightly due to the explicit `OfNat.ofNat`.
2.  **Goals simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?** The main goal (Goal 1) is now slightly more complex due to the introduction of `OfNat.ofNat`. More importantly, a new, unrelated goal (Goal 2) has been introduced. This new goal `(∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (x + 1)).AtLeastTwo` is an assumption generated by the rewrite, which means the tactic found a `Nat.cast_eq_ofNat` instance that requires this proof, but this instance is unlikely to be helpful. The sum `∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (x + 1)` is clearly greater than or equal to 2 (it's a sum of 98 positive integers, starting from 1), so proving this new goal should be trivial with `simp` or `norm_num`. However, introducing such a goal without any real simplification of the initial goal is not progress.
3.  **Goal structure change?** The goal count increased from 1 to 2. While the second goal is trivial, introducing it without significant benefit to the first goal indicates that this rewrite was not particularly useful.
4.  **Likely to lead to a solution?** Unlikely. This tactic did not perform any algebraic manipulation or simplification that would help solve the core problem of equating the sum. It just changed the representation of a natural number cast.

**Conclusion:** The tactic introduced an `OfNat.ofNat` term and a new trivial goal, which makes the state slightly more complex without any apparent benefit towards proving the main equality. It's a "random change" that doesn't advance the proof.

The final answer is $\boxed{PRUNE}$

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

Make a precise decision based on the actual goal content changes.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_num_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]_rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1]` effectively changed the order of terms on the right-hand side of the equality in the main goal. This is a very minor change, and it also introduced a new, unproven side goal `IsAddCommutative ℚ`. While `ℚ` (rational numbers) are indeed additively commutative, proving this in Lean might require delving into the definition of `IsAddCommutative` for `ℚ`, which is not directly relevant to the original problem of summing an arithmetic progression.

The progress is minimal, the goal count increased, and the new goal is an basic property of `ℚ` that is unlikely to simplify the main arithmetic sum goal. This suggests a random or less targeted application of rewrites.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_ring_rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]_rw[CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1]` applied to the main goal of type `RHS = LHS` resulted in generating a new goal `IsMulCommutative ℚ`. This new goal is completely unrelated to the original problem of proving an equality involving sums and rational numbers. It introduces an irrelevant and unhelpful structure. The number of goals increased from 1 to 2, and one of the goals is a property of the type `ℚ` which does not help in solving the original algebraic problem. This is a clear indicator that the tactic moved the proof state away from a solvable form.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_norm_num_rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1]` is intended to rewrite an expression using the proof that `ℚ` (the type of rational numbers) is an additive commutative group.

However, the application of this tactic here is problematic:

1.  **Increased Goal Count:** The number of goals increased from 1 to 2.
2.  **Irrelevant New Goal:** Goal 2 `⊢ IsAddCommutative ℚ` is an unhelpful side goal. `ℚ` is indeed an additive commutative group, but proving this fact (or rather, using its proof) in this context does not simplify the main problem. The original goal was an algebraic identity involving sums and rational numbers. This new goal is a type class instance proof, which is almost certainly already available in Lean's environment or trivial to prove, but it doesn't help in solving the main algebraic sum.
3.  **Minimal Change to Main Goal:** Goal 1 is identical to the original goal, except the right-hand side has its terms reordered (4851 + 98 * u 0 instead of 98 * u 0 + 4851). This reordering is a direct consequence of `IsAddCommutative ℚ`, but it doesn't simplify the expression or make it easier to prove.

The tactic appears to be applied in a way that introduces an arbitrary and irrelevant sub-proof obligation (`IsAddCommutative ℚ`) without making substantial progress on the actual mathematical identity. This suggests a random or misdirected application of a rewrite rule.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_ring_rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1]` applied to the original goal `⊢ ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + ↑(1 + x)) = 4851 + u 0 * 98` has split it into two goals.

The first goal `⊢ ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + ↑(1 + x)) = u 0 * 98 + 4851` is essentially the same as the original goal, just with the right-hand side commuted. This is a minor re-arrangement and offers no simplification.

The second goal `⊢ IsAddCommutative ℚ` is an unhelpful side goal. While `ℚ` is indeed an additive commutative group, proving this as a separate goal is not relevant to the original problem of evaluating the sum. This indicates that the `rw` tactic was used out of context, likely substituting an equality that simplifies an `AddCommGroup` statement but introduces a proof obligation for commutativity that is not directly helping the main problem.

This kind of tactic application indicates a random change rather than a targeted simplification or decomposition of the original problem. The introduction of an irrelevant proof obligation makes the state worse.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_simp_rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1] - **Analysis:**

The tactic `rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1]` significantly increased the number of goals from 1 to 2.

Goal 1 became: `∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + (↑x + 1)) = ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (↑x + 1) + 98 * u 0`. This is essentially the same as the original goal with the two terms on the right side swapped, which is likely allowed by commutativity of addition. This change alone doesn't represent significant progress.

Goal 2 became: `IsAddCommutative ℚ`. This new goal is completely unrelated to the original problem, which is about sums of a sequence. Introducing this auxiliary goal, which is a property of the type `ℚ` itself, is an unnecessary detour and does not simplify the original problem. It suggests that the `rw` tactic was applied to an equation that involved some implicit use of `AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative`. While `ℚ` *is* an additive commutative group, proving this fact is not the objective here.

Therefore, this tactic made the problem more complex by introducing an irrelevant subgoal, and the progress on the original goal is minimal. This suggests an unhelpful application of the `rw` tactic.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_simp_rw[CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1]` is intended to rewrite an expression using the proof of commutativity in a commutative monoid. However, in this context:

1.  **Irrelevant Tactic Application**: The left-hand side of the goal `∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + (↑x + 1))` is a sum, not directly an expression where `CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1` would apply naturally to simplify `98 * u 0` to `u 0 * 98`, which is what happened in Goal 1. This rewrite is trivial and likely not what was intended. The goal was to prove the distributive property of summation, not commutativity of multiplication.
2.  **Increased Goal Count with Trivial/Irrelevant Subgoal**: The tactic split the single goal into two. Goal 1 is a trivial syntactic rearrangement (swapping `98 * u 0` to `u 0 * 98`) which doesn't advance the proof of the summation identity. Goal 2 is `⊢ IsMulCommutative ℚ`, which is a definitional property of rational numbers and completely irrelevant to the original summation problem. It appears as an implicit side condition of the `rw` tactic if the rewrite rule itself involves such a typeclass instance.
3.  **No Progress Towards the Original Goal**: The original goal was to show that `∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + (↑x + 1))` equals `98 * u 0 + ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (↑x + 1)`. This is a property of summation (specifically, splitting a sum of terms where one term is constant) that could be proven using `Finset.sum_add_distrib` and `Finset.sum_const`. The current tactic `rw[CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1]` does not address this at all.

This application of `rw` is a misstep and introduces an irrelevant subgoal while making no meaningful progress on the core problem.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve

`⊢ ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + ↑(x + 1)) = ↑(∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (x + 1)) + 98 * u 0`

AFTER:
`⊢ ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + ↑(x + 1)) = ↑(∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (x + 1)) + u 0 * 98`

The tactic `rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]` has changed the term `98 * u 0` to `u 0 * 98` on the right-hand side of the equality. This is a purely cosmetic change due to the commutativity of multiplication. It does not simplify the expression, decompose the problem, or bring the goal closer to a solvable form. It's a standard mathematical equivalence, but in the context of a proof search, it doesn't represent meaningful progress.

Therefore, this tactic application is not helpful.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]_rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2] - Explanation: The tactic `rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2]` changed `1` to `↑1` in the goal. This is a very minor, likely irrelevant, and certainly not simplifying change. The proof `two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2` suggests an algebraic manipulation related to `2 + 2 = 4`, which is entirely out of context for the current goal involving sums and rational numbers. This tactic seems to be an arbitrary substitution that doesn't advance the proof and might even make it slightly harder to read due to the unnecessary explicit coercion `↑1`. This branch is not making meaningful progress.

2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

Make a precise decision based on the actual goal content changes.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_num_norm_cast_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]_rw[CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1]` applied to the original goal, which was an arithmetic equality involving sums, did the following:

- It replaced `u 0 * 98` with `98 * u 0` in the first goal, which is a trivial commutative change that `norm_num` or `ring` would handle automatically if needed. This doesn't simplify the core sum significantly.
- **Crucially, it introduced a new second goal: `IsMulCommutative ℚ`**. This goal is completely unrelated to the original arithmetic problem. While `ℚ` (the type of rational numbers) is indeed commutative, proving this explicitely in the middle of a sum calculation suggests that the applied rewrite rule was not the intended one or was misapplied.

The second goal `IsMulCommutative ℚ` is an unhelpful distraction. The tactic `CommMonoid.ofIsMulCommutative._proof_1` is likely an internal proof or lemma that's not meant for direct application in this context and its introduction here appears to be a misstep.

The state is now more complex (2 goals instead of 1), and one of the new goals is irrelevant to the original problem. This is a clear sign to prune the branch.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_num_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]_rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]_rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2] - The tactic `rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2]` seems to be a custom definition/proof, likely `2+2=4`. Its application here changed `(↑k + 1)` to `(↑k + ↑1)`. This is a trivial change and does not simplify or advance the proof in any meaningful way. It appears to be an irrelevant and unhelpful transformation, indicating a random or misguided application of a tactic.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_ring_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]_rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2]_rw[Nat.cast_ofNat] - The tactic `rw[Nat.cast_ofNat]` has increased the number of goals from 1 to 2, introducing a new goal `⊢ AtLeastTwo 1`. This new goal is an artifact of the `Nat.cast_ofNat` lemma, which likely has a precondition that `1` must be "at least two" in certain contexts (though `1` is clearly not at least two, suggesting an improper application or a definition of `AtLeastTwo` which is trivial for literal 1). This is completely irrelevant to the original problem of simplifying the summation. The original goal changed from `(↑1 + u 0 + ↑x)` to `(1 + u 0 + ↑x)`. While casting `1` to a rational number might eventually be necessary, this specific application of `Nat.cast_ofNat` has backfired, introducing an unhelpful and potentially false side goal. This indicates a deviation from meaningful progress.

However, in the provided proof state, there is no `2 + 2` to rewrite. The only apparent change is `↑1` becoming `↑↑1` in the first argument of the sum on the left-hand side of the goal. This is nonsensical and suggests a misapplication or misunderstanding of the tactic or an issue with the environment. This change does not simplify the goal, make it more approachable, or move it in a discernible positive direction. It actively introduces a nonsensical term `↑↑1`.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

Make a precise decision based on the actual goal content changes.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

Make a precise decision based on the actual goal content changes.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_ring_rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]_rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1]` applied to the main goal created a second unhelpful goal `IsAddCommutative ℚ`. This goal is trivial, but it's not the main objective of the proof. The original goal, which involved algebraic manipulation, was simply reordered (4851 + u 0 * 98 instead of u 0 * 98 + 4851), which does not constitute progress. This tactic did not simplify the original goal or decompose it into smaller, more manageable parts. Instead, it introduced a new, irrelevant goal and did not advance the main calculation.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_ring_rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm] - The latest tactic, `rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]`, applied to the right-hand side of the main goal, changed `u 0 * 98` to `98 * u 0`. This is a trivial algebraic rearrangement.

1. **Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?** While not a large step, it's a normalization. It makes the expression `98 * u 0` consistent with the common convention of putting the scalar multiplier first, which can sometimes aid in pattern matching for future lemmas or rewrites (e.g., distributive laws). It's not "meaningful" in the sense of solving a significant part of the problem, but it's a valid simplification/normalization.

2. **Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?** The goal is neither simpler nor more complex in a significant way; it's a reordering of terms. It's not fundamentally different.

3. **Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?** Yes, it makes the term `98 * u 0` align with a common convention, which can be seen as a positive normalization, even if minor.

4. **Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?** This particular step isn't a "search direction" in itself but rather a small algebraic manipulation within the current expression. The overall direction of the proof seems to be working with the summation and trying to evaluate it. The tactics applied so far (`norm_cast`, `ring`, `rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]`, `rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]`) are all standard algebraic/arithmetic simplification tactics. The previous tactics were also aimed at simplifying the summation and expressing `u n` in terms of `u 0`. This continues that trend of algebraic manipulation.

Even though `rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]` is a very small step, it is a valid simplification/normalization, and it does not make the goal worse or more complex. It's part of a general strategy of simplifying expressions. Therefore, there's no reason to prune the branch based on this tactic.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_simp_rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]_rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1] - The tactic `rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1]` applied to the given goal, which is an equality between sums, results in two goals. The first goal is essentially the same as the original goal, but with the right-hand side `∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (↑x + 1) + 98 * u 0` reordered to `98 * u 0 + ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (↑x + 1)`. This reordering provides no real simplification or progress.

The second goal `IsAddCommutative ℚ` is a new, completely unrelated goal that has been introduced. While `ℚ` is indeed an additive commutative group, proving `IsAddCommutative ℚ` is not a step towards proving the original equality involving concrete sums. This new goal is a direct consequence of the proof term `AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1` which is a proof that `ℚ` is an additive commutative group. Using such a proof term directly with `rw` on an equality often means that a lemma about additive commutativity was applied in a way that splits off the premise of that lemma as a new goal.

This tactic has not simplified the primary goal and has introduced an entirely new, irrelevant goal. This indicates a misguided application of `rw`, which has made the proof state more complex without benefit.

         🤖 LLM CONTINUE: hole_3_norm_cast_simp_rw[AddCommGroup.add_comm]_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm] - The tactic `rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]` changed `98 * u 0` to `u 0 * 98`. This is a purely cosmetic change and does not inherently simplify or complicate the goal. However, it's a valid rewrite rule and sometimes such normalizations can help future tactics (e.g., if a different proof term is structured as `c * x` instead of `x * c`). Since it hasn't made the goal *worse* and is a standard simplification/normalization, it's not a reason to prune. It's a neutral step, so we continue.

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_simp_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]_rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1] - The latest tactic, `rw[AddCommGroup.ofIsAddCommutative._proof_1]`, changed the main goal. It appears to apply a rewrite rule from the `AddCommGroup` type class. This has two major issues:

1.  **Increased Goal Count and Irrelevant Goal:** The tactic introduced a second goal: `IsAddCommutative ℚ`. While `ℚ` (rational numbers) are indeed additively commutative, proving this explicitly is almost certainly not the intended path of the main problem. This suggests the rewrite rule being applied is either too broad or incorrectly chosen for this context. It's bringing in a low-level type class property that should ideally be handled automatically by Lean's type class inference or by a more specific sum-related lemma.
2.  **Unclear Benefit to Main Goal:** The first goal became `∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (u 0 + (↑x + 1)) = ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (↑x + 1) + u 0 * 98`. This looks like it's trying to use commutativity of addition to reorder terms, but such properties within `∑` (summation) are usually handled by lemmas like `Finset.sum_add_distrib` or by exploiting the underlying ring or group structure directly without needing to delve into `IsAddCommutative` proofs. The current transformation doesn't simplify the expression for the sum in a way that directly leads to the original goal of `u 0 * 98 + ∑ x ∈ Finset.range 98, (↑x + 1)`. It just reordered the terms on the right-hand side, effectively swapping `A + B` to `B + A`.

This tactic seems to be misapplied. It increased the goal count with an irrelevant goal, and the change to the primary goal doesn't provide a clear, direct simplification needed to prove the original statement. It's likely a blind application of a rewrite rule from a deep library proof.

Analyze the change from BEFORE to AFTER:

1. Is the latest tactic making meaningful progress toward the goal?
2. Are the goals becoming simpler, more complex, or fundamentally different?
3. Did the goal structure change in a positive way (even if goal count stayed same)?
4. Is this search direction likely to lead to a solution?

Guidelines:
- CONTINUE if goals are simplified, normalized, or transformed positively
- CONTINUE if goal count decreased or stayed same with useful transformation
- CONTINUE if goal is decomposed into smaller goals that are easier to solve
- PRUNE if goal count increased significantly without clear benefit and not becoming easier to solve
- PRUNE if goals became more complex or moved away from solvable form
- PRUNE if tactic introduced irrelevant or unhelpful structure

**PRUNE if the tactic and state change is not helpful for the goal, and just doing random changes**

Make a precise decision based on the actual goal content changes.

Respond with exactly one of:
PRUNE - if this branch should be abandoned
CONTINUE - if this branch should be explored further

         🤖 LLM PRUNE: hole_3_norm_cast_simp_rw[CommMagma.mul_comm]_rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2] - The tactic `rw[two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2]` changed `1` to `↑1`. This is a very minor, almost imperceptible, change and does not seem to contribute to solving the goal. It implies that `two_add_two_eq_four._proof_1_2` essentially proves `2 + 2 = 4`, and rewriting with it likely aims to replace an instance of `4` with `2 + 2`. However, in this specific case, it seems to have affected the `1` in `↑x + 1`, turning it into `↑x + ↑1`. This kind of trivial change indicates the tactic is not making meaningful progress and is likely a misapplication that will not lead to a solution. The goal is an algebraic manipulation of sums, and this rewrite does not simplify the sum or its components in any beneficial way.
