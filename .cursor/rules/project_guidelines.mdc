# Project Guidelines
- Always use English when writing code, but you can use 中文 when communicating.
- When you consider a feature complete, or have added new functionality, structural changes, etc., and those changes are finished rather than still in progress, please update the Markdown files in the docs folder.
- use pytest if you want to write test
- Keep checking and updating the `docs/` directory.
- Never add any unnecessary `try-except` blocks when encountering errors. Solve the problem instead of hiding it. Don't add error handling. Instead, let error happens so we can find bugs.
- When running a task (or before running a task), first update the taskflow documentation (`docs/taskflow.md` or similar) to specify your understanding and plan, and mark it as complete or not after finishing.
- All data related to running multiple lean-related processes should be stored under a path like `minif2f/<foldername>/<datafile>`.
- Run things automaticly by yourself after implementation.
- 当你运行一个脚本但是脚本没有输出的时候，可能是cursor本身终端运行写的有问题。请停下，把那个命令交给我来运行。
