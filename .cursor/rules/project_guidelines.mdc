# Project Guidelines

- Always use English when writing code, but you can use 中文 when communicating.
- Keep checking and updating the `docs/` directory.
- Don't add too many unnecessary `try-except` blocks when encountering errors. Solve the problem instead of hiding it.
- When running a task (or before running a task), first update the taskflow documentation (`docs/taskflow.md` or similar) to specify your understanding and plan, and mark it as complete or not after finishing.
- All data related to running multiple lean-related processes should be stored under a path like `minif2f/<foldername>/<datafile>`.
