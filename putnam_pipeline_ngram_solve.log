Let $S$ be a set of real numbers which is closed under multiplication (that is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $S$, then so is $ab$). Let $T$ and $U$ be disjoint subsets of $S$ whose union is $S$. Given that the product of any {\em three} (not necessarily distinct) elements of $T$ is in $T$ and that the product of any three elements of $U$ is in $U$, show that at least one of the two subsets $T,U$ is closed under multiplication.

Define $\left\lVert x \right\rVert$ as the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. Find $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \int_{1}^{n} \left\lVert \frac{n}{x} \right\rVert \, dx$. You may assume that $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2n}{(2n-1)} \cdot \frac{2n}{(2n+1)} = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Define $\left\lVert x \right\rVert$ as the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. Find $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \int_{1}^{n} \left\lVert \frac{n}{x} \right\rVert \, dx$. You may assume that $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2n}{(2n-1)} \cdot \frac{2n}{(2n+1)} = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Suppose that $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty c_i x^i$ is a power series for which each coefficient $c_i$ is $0$ or $1$. Show that if $f(2/3) = 3/2$, then $f(1/2)$ must be irrational.

Suppose that $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty c_i x^i$ is a power series for which each coefficient $c_i$ is $0$ or $1$. Show that if $f(2/3) = 3/2$, then $f(1/2)$ must be irrational.

def klimited (k n : ℕ) (s : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) := ∀ i, |((s i) : ℤ) - i| ≤ k
/--
Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. Say that a permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\} is $k-limited$ if \|\sigma(i) - i\| \leq k$ for all $i$. Prove that the number of $k-limited$ permutations $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is odd if and only if $n \equiv 0$ or $1 (mod 2k+1)$.

    ❌ Original tactic failed for hole_95: Lean error:
tactic 'rewrite' failed, motive is not type correct:
  fun _a => _a ∈ {s | klimited k n s}
Error: unknown constant 'klimited'

Explanation: The rewrite tactic rewrites an expression 'e' using an equality 'a = b' by the following process. First, it looks for all 'a' in 'e'. Second, it tries to abstract these occurrences of 'a' to create a function 'm := fun _a => ...', called the *motive*, with the property that 'm a' is definitionally equal to 'e'. Third, we observe that 'congrArg' implies that 'm a = m b', which can be used with lemmas such as 'Eq.mpr' to change the goal. However, if 'e' depends on specific properties of 'a', then the motive 'm' might not typecheck.

Possible solutions: use rewrite's 'occs' configuration option to limit which occurrences are rewritten, or use 'simp' or 'conv' mode, which have strategies for certain kinds of dependencies (these tactics can handle proofs and 'Decidable' instances whose types depend on the rewritten term, and 'simp' can apply user-defined '@[congr]' theorems as well).

def klimited (k n : ℕ) (s : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) := ∀ i, |((s i) : ℤ) - i| ≤ k
/--
Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. Say that a permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,2,\dots,n\} is $k-limited$ if \|\sigma(i) - i\| \leq k$ for all $i$. Prove that the number of $k-limited$ permutations $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is odd if and only if $n \equiv 0$ or $1 (mod 2k+1)$.

Let $A$ be a $2n \times 2n$ matrix, with entries chosen independently at random. Every entry is chosen to be $0$ or $1$, each with probability $1/2$. Find the expected value of $\det(A-A^t)$ (as a function of $n$), where $A^t$ is the transpose of $A$.

Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle in the Euclidean plane, with points $P$, $Q$, and $R$ lying on segments $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$, $\overline{AB}$ respectively such that $$\frac{AQ}{QC} = \frac{BR}{RA} = \frac{CP}{PB} = k$$ for some positive constant $k$. If $\triangle UVW$ is the triangle formed by parts of segments $\overline{AP}$, $\overline{BQ}$, and $\overline{CR}$, prove that $$\frac{[\triangle UVW]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{(k - 1)^2}{k^2 + k + 1},$$ where $[\triangle]$ denotes the area of the triangle $\triangle$.

An ordered triple $(a, b, c)$ of positive irrational numbers with $a + b + c = 1$ is considered $\textit{balanced}$ if all three elements are less than $\frac{1}{2}$. If a triple is not balanced, we can perform a ``balancing act'' $B$ defined by $B(a, b, c) = (f(a), f(b), f(c))$, where $f(x) = 2x - 1$ if $x > 1/2$ and $f(x) = 2x$ otherwise. Will finitely many iterations of this balancing act always eventually produce a balanced triple?

An $m \times n$ checkerboard is colored randomly: each square is independently assigned red or black with probability $1/2$. We say that two squares, $p$ and $q$, are in the same connected monochromatic region if there is a sequence of squares, all of the same color, starting at $p$ and ending at $q$, in which successive squares in the sequence share a common side. Show that the expected number of connected monochromatic regions is greater than $m n / 8$.

Let $y(x)$ be a continuously differentiable real-valued function of a real vairable $x$. Show that if $(y')^2 + y^3 \to 0$ as $x \to +\infty$, then $y(x)$ and $y'(x) \to 0$ as $x \to +\infty$.

Let $B_n(x) = 1^x + 2^x + \dots + n^x$ and let $f(n) = \frac{B_n(\log_n 2)}{(n \log_2 n)^2}$. Does $f(2) + f(3) + f(4) + \dots$ converge?

For $m \geq 3$, a list of $\binom{m}{3}$ real numbers $a_{ijk}$ ($1 \leq i<j<k \leq m$) is said to be \emph{area definite} for $\mathbb{R}^n$ if the inequality $\sum_{1 \leq i<j<k \leq m} a_{ijk} \cdot \text{Area}(\Delta A_iA_jA_k) \geq 0$ holds for every choice of $m$ points $A_1,\dots,A_m$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. For example, the list of four numbers $a_{123}=a_{124}=a_{134}=1$, $a_{234}=-1$ is area definite for $\mathbb{R}^2$. Prove that if a list of $\binom{m}{3}$ numbers is area definite for $\mathbb{R}^2$, then it is area definite for $\mathbb{R}^3$.
