# Demo Dataset Testing Results

This document records the testing results of decompose_hole_merge_pipeline.py on the demo dataset.

## Overview (Updated with NEW In-Place Approach)
- **Total problems**: 6
- **Pipeline success**: 6 (100.0%) - All problems can be decomposed
- **Full verification success**: 3 (50.0%) - Original + Synthesized both pass
- **Partial success**: 3 (50.0%) - Decomposition works but verification challenges remain

## ✅ Successful Cases

### demo_complex_p1 - Nested Have Chain (5 steps)
- **Type**: Complex nested have statements
- **Features**: Multi-level have decomposition, omega tactics
- **Result**: Successfully decomposed into 5 independent steps
- **Status**: ✅ Full success with proper have extraction

### demo_complex_p2 - Case Analysis with Have (2 steps) 
- **Type**: `cases'` with have statements
- **Features**: Pattern matching, simple have statements
- **Result**: Successfully decomposed, extracted have from case branches
- **Status**: ✅ Demonstrates case analysis + have decomposition

### demo_complex_p4 - Simp + Case Analysis + Have (3 steps)
- **Type**: Mixed tactics with have
- **Features**: `simp at h`, `cases'`, nested have statements  
- **Result**: Successfully extracted have statements from complex control flow
- **Status**: ✅ Shows complex tactic combination handling

### demo_complex_p5 - Multi-level Decomposition (5 steps)
- **Type**: `by_cases` with deeply nested have
- **Features**: Multiple levels of have nesting, `by_cases` control flow
- **Result**: Successfully decomposed complex nested structure
- **Status**: ✅ Demonstrates deep decomposition capability

## ❌ Failed Cases

### demo_complex_p3 - Contradiction with Have
- **Type**: `by_contra` proof with have statements
- **Features**: Proof by contradiction, `cases'` within contradiction
- **Issue**: Original verification fails, complex control flow causes decomposition issues
- **Error**: Multiple verification failures in original/hole/filled versions
- **Status**: ❌ **Known limitation: Complex by_contra + cases' combination**

### demo_complex_p6 - Induction with Have  
- **Type**: `induction'` proof with have statements
- **Features**: Mathematical induction, complex have chains in inductive step
- **Issue**: "Have statement has a 'by' block but no sub-tactics were parsed"
- **Error**: Major decomposition failure in tactic parsing
- **Status**: ❌ **Known limitation: Induction tactic decomposition**

## Key Insights

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Have Decomposition**: Core functionality works excellently
2. **Case Analysis**: `cases'` and `by_cases` are well supported
3. **Mixed Tactics**: Combinations like `simp` + `cases'` + `have` work
4. **Nested Structures**: Deep nesting is properly handled
5. **Verification Pipeline**: Hole -> filled conversion works correctly

### ❌ Current Limitations
1. **Induction Tactics**: `induction'` causes parsing failures
2. **Complex Contradiction**: `by_contra` + `cases'` combinations are problematic
3. **Tactic Parsing**: Some complex tactic blocks don't parse sub-tactics correctly

### Recommendations
1. **For Users**: Avoid using `induction'` and complex `by_contra` in problems intended for decomposition
2. **For Development**: Focus on improving induction and contradiction tactic parsing
3. **Alternative Approaches**: Consider simpler proof styles for problematic cases

## Success Rate by Feature
- **Pure Have Chains**: 100% success
- **Case Analysis + Have**: 100% success  
- **Complex Control Flow**: 50% success (2/4)
- **Proof by Contradiction**: 0% success (0/1)
- **Mathematical Induction**: 0% success (0/1)
