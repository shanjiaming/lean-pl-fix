# Putnam 2007 B6 Hole Digging Debugging Record

## Project Overview

This is a debugging record for the Lean theorem proving automation system that automatically fixes errors in Lean mathematical proof code using program synthesis techniques. The system works by "digging holes" to handle failing tactics.

## Core Problem Statement

User discovered that `putnam_2007_b6` contains failing nlinarith calls that should be automatically handled by the hole digging program, but the system gets stuck on:

1. Multi-line nlinarith calls not being correctly identified and replaced
2. API compatibility errors like `Set.one_le_ncard_iff.mpr` blocking the pipeline flow

User expectation: **"The hole digging program should naturally dig out failing tactics and continue processing, without getting stuck on API errors."**

## Technical Details

### Original Problem Location
- **File:** `/home/matheye/lean-pl-fix/dataset/putnam/putnam_2007_b6.lean`
- **Problematic nlinarith at lines 92-93:**
```lean
nlinarith [Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos (by positivity : 0 < (n : ℝ)), Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos (by positivity : 0 < (2 : ℝ)),
  Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos (by positivity : 0 < (n : ℝ))]
```

### Hole Digging Logic
- **Main method:** `DecomposeHoleMergePipeline._process_content_for_holes()`
- **Problem:** `lean_interact`'s tactic tree parsing doesn't correctly capture complex multi-line nlinarith calls
- **Supplementary method:** `_detect_missed_tactics()` attempts to detect missed tactics

### Current Implementation Status

**File:** `/home/matheye/lean-pl-fix/decompose_hole_merge_pipeline.py`

Key method `_detect_missed_tactics()` at lines 629-751 attempts to:
1. Detect multi-line nlinarith patterns
2. Calculate correct replacement positions  
3. Generate hole information for subsequent replacement

**Critical Issues:**
- Position calculation logic is complex and error-prone
- Multi-line text parsing boundary handling is inaccurate
- Residual parameters remain after replacement

## Test Results

### Command Used
```bash
python decompose_hole_merge_pipeline.py problem putnam putnam_2007_b6
```

### Current Output Shows
- Detected 2 missed nlinarith (lines 52-53 and 92-93)
- hole_38 created to replace lines 92-93 nlinarith
- But output shows coordinates `Start(92, 14) -> End(93, 73)` still incomplete

### Generated Hole Version
- **File:** `/home/matheye/lean-pl-fix/decomposition_results/putnam/decomposed/putnam_2007_b6/hole_version.lean`
- **Lines 111-113 now show:**
```lean
hole_38
exact h₂₀
```

## Verification Status

### Latest Verification Results
- **Hole version verification:** FAIL
- **Error count:** 12 errors
- **Error types:** Mainly "no goals to be solved"(8) and other structural errors(4)
- **IMPORTANT:** Set.one_le_ncard_iff.mpr API errors have been handled (0 count)
- **IMPORTANT:** nlinarith-related errors have been handled (0 count)

## Manual Modification History (NEEDS TO BE REVERTED)

**WARNING:** During debugging, manual modifications were incorrectly made to the following files:

1. `/home/matheye/lean-pl-fix/decomposition_results/putnam/decomposed/putnam_2007_b6/hole_version.lean`
   - Manually cleaned residual nlinarith parameters
   - Manually replaced Set.one_le_ncard_iff.mpr calls
   - Manually added hole macros

**These manual modifications need to be reverted. The program should automatically generate the correct hole version.**

## Core Problem Analysis

1. **Position calculation errors:** Multi-line text position calculation in `_detect_missed_tactics` still has bugs
2. **Boundary handling inaccuracies:** Logic for determining start/end positions of complex multi-line nlinarith has issues  
3. **API error handling:** Set.one_le_ncard_iff.mpr should be automatically identified as a failing tactic that needs hole digging

## Tasks Remaining

1. **Fix position calculation logic** - Ensure `_detect_missed_tactics` can correctly calculate the complete range of multi-line nlinarith
2. **Enhance API error detection** - Make hole digging logic automatically identify and handle API compatibility errors
3. **Regenerate clean hole version** - Rely completely on program automation, without any manual modifications

## File Status

### Core Code Files
- `decompose_hole_merge_pipeline.py` - Main hole digging logic
- `decompose_solver.py` - Supporting parsing logic

### Test Files  
- `dataset/putnam/putnam_2007_b6.lean` - Original problem file
- `decomposition_results/putnam/decomposed/putnam_2007_b6/` - Processing results directory (contains manual modifications, needs regeneration)

## Current Assessment

**Current Status:** The program's automatic hole digging functionality partially works, but still has defects when handling complex multi-line tactics. Manual modifications have masked these issues, and we need to return to a purely programmatic solution.

**User Expectation:** The hole digging program should completely automatically handle failing tactics, including complex multi-line nlinarith and API compatibility errors, without any manual intervention.

## Key Lesson Learned

**Manual file editing is not a solution.** Hole digging must be accomplished by the program automatically. Any manual modifications defeat the purpose of automated error handling and should be avoided.

**Status:** Active debugging required
**Priority:** High
**Next Action:** Revert manual changes and fix the programmatic hole detection logic
