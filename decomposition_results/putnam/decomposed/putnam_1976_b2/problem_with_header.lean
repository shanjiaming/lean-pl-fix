Let $G$ be a group generated by two elements $A$ and $B$; i.e., every element of $G$ can be expressed as a finite word $A^{n_1}B^{n_2} \cdots A^{n_{k-1}}B^{n_k}$, where the $n_i$ can assume any integer values and $A^0 = B^0 = 1$. Further assume that $A^4 = B^7 = ABA^{-1}B = 1$, but $A^2 \ne 1$ and $B \ne 1$. Find the number of elements of $G$ than can be written as $C^2$ for some $C \in G$ and express each such square as a word in $A$ and $B$.
