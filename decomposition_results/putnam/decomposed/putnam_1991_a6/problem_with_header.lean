Let $A(n)$ denote the number of sums of positive integers $a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_r$ which add up to $n$ with $a_1>a_2+a_3,a_2>a_3+a_4,\dots,a_{r-2}>a_{r-1}+a_r,a_{r-1}>a_r$. Let $B(n)$ denote the number of $b_1+b_2+\cdots+b_s$ which add up to $n$, with
\begin{enumerate}
\item $b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \dots \geq b_s$,
\item each $b_i$ is in the sequence $1,2,4,\dots,g_j,\dots$ defined by $g_1=1$, $g_2=2$, and $g_j=g_{j-1}+g_{j-2}+1$, and
\item if $b_1=g_k$ then every element in $\{1,2,4,\dots,g_k\}$ appears at least once as a $b_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Prove that $A(n)=B(n)$ for each $n \geq 1$. (For example, $A(7)=5$ because the relevant sums are $7,6+1,5+2,4+3,4+2+1$, and $B(7)=5$ because the relevant sums are $4+2+1,2+2+2+1,2+2+1+1+1,2+1+1+1+1+1,1+1+1+1+1+1+1$.)
