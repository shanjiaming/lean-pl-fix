-- Note: This formalization uses "Type" instead of "Type*" for an algebraic structure (a set with a bypass operation). Also, the original problem asks for a witness to the existentially quantified statement in the goal.

A binary operation (represented by multiplication) on $S$ has the property that $(ab)(cd) = ad$ for all $a, b, c, d$. Show that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] if $ab = c$, then $cc = c$;
\item[(2)] if $ab = c$, then $ad = cd$ for all $d$.
\end{itemize}
Find a set $S$, and such a binary operation, which also satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(A)] $a a = a$ for all $a$;
\item[(B)] $ab = a \neq b$ for some $a, b$;
\item[(C)] $ab \neq a$ for some $a, b$.
\end{itemize}
