If $p(x)= a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_m x^m$ is a polynomial with real coefficients $a_i$, then set
\[
\Gamma(p(x)) = a_0^2 + a_1^2 + \cdots + a_m^2.
\]
Let $F(x) = 3x^2+7x+2$. Find, with proof, a polynomial $g(x)$ with real coefficients such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $g(0)=1$, and
\item[(ii)] $\Gamma(f(x)^n) = \Gamma(g(x)^n)$
\end{enumerate}
for every integer $n \geq 1$.
