Let $S_0$ be a finite set of positive integers. We define finite sets $S_1,S_2,\ldots$ of positive integers as follows: the integer $a$ is in $S_{n+1}$ if and only if exactly one of $a-1$ or $a$ is in $S_n$. Show that there exist infinitely many integers $N$ for which $S_N=S_0\cup\{N+a: a\in S_0\}$.
