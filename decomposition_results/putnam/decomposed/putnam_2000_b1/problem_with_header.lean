Let $a_j,b_j,c_j$ be integers for $1\leq j\leq N$. Assume for each $j$, at least one of $a_j,b_j,c_j$ is odd. Show that there exist integers $r$, $s$, $t$ such that $ra_j+sb_j+tc_j$ is odd for at least $4N/7$ values of $j$, $1\leq j\leq N$.

    -- We will use the fact that for each j, at least 4 out of 7 non-zero configurations in F_2^3 make the sum r*a_j + s*b_j + t*c_j odd

    -- Consider all non-zero (r, s, t) in {0,1}^3. There are 7 such vectors.
    -- For each j, at least 4 of these vectors make the sum r*a_j + s*b_j + t*c_j odd.
    -- Therefore, the total number of (j, (r, s, t)) pairs where the sum is odd is at least 4N.
    -- By the pigeonhole principle, at least one (r, s, t) cannot be less than (4N/7).
    -- We will use Lean4's sum and card to show that the sum of the number of j's that work for each configuration is at least 4N.
