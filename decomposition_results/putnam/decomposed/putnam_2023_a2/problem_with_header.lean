/--
Let $n$ be an even positive integer. Let $p$ be a monic, real polynomial of degree $2n$; that is to say, $p(x) = x^{2n} + a_{2n-1} x^{2n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ for some real coefficients $a_0, \dots, a_{2n-1}$. Suppose that $p(1/k) = k^2$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \leq |k| \leq n$. Find all other real numbers $x$ for which $p(1/x) = x^2$.
