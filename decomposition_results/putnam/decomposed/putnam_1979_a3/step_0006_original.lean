theorem h₄ (x : ℕ → ℝ) (hx : ∀ (n : ℕ), x n ≠ 0 ∧ (n ≥ 3 → x n = x (n - 2) * x (n - 1) / (2 * x (n - 2) - x (n - 1)))) (h :  match (x 1, x 2) with  | (a, b) => ∃ m, a = ↑m ∧ b = ↑m) (m✝ : ℤ) (hm₁ : x 1 = ↑m✝) (hm₂ : x 2 = ↑m✝) (h₂ : ∀ n ≥ 1, x n = ↑m✝) (m : ℕ) : x (m + 1) = ↑m := by
  have h₅ : (m + 1 : ℕ) ≥ 1 := by sorry
  have h₆ : (x (m + 1) : ℝ) = m := by sorry
