Let $n$ be a positive integer. Determine, in terms of $n$, the largest integer $m$ with the following property: There exist real numbers $x_1,\dots,x_{2n}$ with $-1<x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_{2n}<1$ such that the sum of the lengths of the $n$ intervals $[x_1^{2k-1},x_2^{2k-1}],[x_3^{2k-1},x_4^{2k-1}],\dots,[x_{2n-1}^{2k-1},x_{2n}^{2k-1}]$ is equal to $1$ for all integers $k$ with $1 \leq k \leq m$.
