-- (fun a b : ℝ => |Real.log (a / b)|)
/--
Let $a$ and $b$ be positive numbers. Find the largest number $c$, in terms of $a$ and $b$, such that $a^xb^{1-x} \leq a\frac{\sinh ux}{\sinh u}+b\frac{\sinh u(1-x)}{\sinh u}$ for all $u$ with $0<|u| \leq c$ and for all $x$, $0<x<1$. (Note: $\sinh u=(e^u-e^{-u})/2$.)
