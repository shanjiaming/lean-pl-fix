For a partition $\pi$ of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$, let $\pi(x)$ be the number of elements in the part containing $x$. Prove that for any two partitions $\pi$ and $\pi'$, there are two distinct numbers $x$ and $y$ in $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ such that $\pi(x) = \pi(y)$ and $\pi'(x) = \pi'(y)$. [A {\em partition} of a set $S$ is a collection of disjoint subsets (parts) whose union is $S$.]
