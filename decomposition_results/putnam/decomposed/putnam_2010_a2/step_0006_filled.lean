theorem h₅₁ (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : f ∈ {f | Differentiable ℝ f ∧ ∀ (x : ℝ), ∀ n > 0, deriv f x = (f (x + ↑n) - f x) / ↑n}) (h₁ : Differentiable ℝ f) (h₂ : ∀ (x : ℝ), ∀ n > 0, deriv f x = (f (x + ↑n) - f x) / ↑n) (x : ℝ) : deriv (deriv f) = 0 :=
  by
  have h₅₂ : ∀ x : ℝ, deriv f (x + 1) = deriv f x := by sorry
  have h₅₃ : deriv (deriv f) = 0 := by sorry
  --  exact h₅₃
