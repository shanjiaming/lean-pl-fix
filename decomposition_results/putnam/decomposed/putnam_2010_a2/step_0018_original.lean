theorem h₅₇ (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : f ∈ {f | Differentiable ℝ f ∧ ∀ (x : ℝ), ∀ n > 0, deriv f x = (f (x + ↑n) - f x) / ↑n}) (h₁ : Differentiable ℝ f) (h₂ : ∀ (x : ℝ), ∀ n > 0, deriv f x = (f (x + ↑n) - f x) / ↑n) (x✝ : ℝ) (h₅ h₅₂ h₅₄ : deriv (deriv f) = 0) (x : ℝ) : deriv f x = deriv f 0 := by
  have h₅₈ : deriv (deriv f) = 0 := h₅₄
  have h₅₉ : deriv f = fun x => deriv f 0 := by sorry
  have h₅₁₀ : deriv f x = deriv f 0 := by sorry
  exact h₅₁₀
