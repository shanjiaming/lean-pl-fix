A dart, thrown at random, hits a square target. Assuming that any two parts of the target of equal area are equally likely to be hit, find the probability that the point hit is nearer to the center than to any edge. Express your answer in the form $(a\sqrt{b}+c)/d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are integers and $b$, $d$ are positive.
