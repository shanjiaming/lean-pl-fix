theorem h₉₁ (a b c d : ℝ) (h₀ : b = a ^ 2) (h₁ : a + b = 1) (h₂ : d = c ^ 2) (h₃ : c + d = 1) (h₄ : a ≠ c) (h₅ : a ^ 2 + a - 1 = 0) (h₆ : c ^ 2 + c - 1 = 0) (h₇ : a + c = -1) (h₈ : a * c = -1) : (a - c) ^ 2 = 5 := by
  have h₉₂ : a ^ 2 + a - 1 = 0 := h₅
  have h₉₃ : c ^ 2 + c - 1 = 0 := h₆
  have h₉₄ : a + c = -1 := h₇
  have h₉₅ : a * c = -1 := h₈
  have h₉₆ : (a - c) ^ 2 = 5 := by sorry
  --  exact h₉₆
