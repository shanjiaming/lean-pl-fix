theorem h₅ (a b : ℕ) (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9) (h₁ : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673) (h₂ : 10 * a + b ≤ 97) (h₃ : 10 * a + b ≥ 97) (h₄ : 10 * a + b = 97) : a = 9 := by
  have h₅₁ : 10 * a + b = 97 := h₄
  have h₅₂ : a ≤ 9 := h₀.2.1
  have h₅₃ : b ≤ 9 := h₀.2.2
  have h₅₄ : 1 ≤ a := h₀.1
  have h₅₅ : a ≥ 9 := by sorry
