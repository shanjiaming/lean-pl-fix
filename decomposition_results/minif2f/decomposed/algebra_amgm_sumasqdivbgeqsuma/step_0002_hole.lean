theorem h₁ (a b c d : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c ∧ 0 < d) : a ^ 2 / b + b ≥ 2 * a := by
  have h₁₁ : 0 < b := by sorry
  have h₁₂ : 0 < a := by sorry
  have h₁₃ : 0 < a ^ 2 / b := by sorry
  have h₁₄ : a ^ 2 / b * b = a ^ 2 := by sorry
  have h₁₅ : a ^ 2 / b + b ≥ 2 * a := by sorry
  --  exact h₁₅
