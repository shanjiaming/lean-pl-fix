theorem h₁ (h :  (∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (-3) 3, (∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (-3) 3, f y ≤ f x) ∧ f x = 41 / 4 ∧ x = 3) ∧    ∃ z ∈ Set.Icc (-3) 3, (∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (-3) 3, f z ≤ f y) ∧ f z = -13 / 3 ∧ z = -2) : f (-3) ≤ f 3 := by
  --  obtain ⟨⟨x, hx₁, hx₂, hx₃, hx₄⟩, ⟨z, hz₁, hz₂, hz₃, hz₄⟩⟩ := h
  have h₅ : f (-3) ≤ f x := hx₂ (-3) (by norm_num)
  have h₆ : x = 3 := hx₄
  have h₇ : f x = 41 / 4 := hx₃
  have h₈ : f (-3) ≤ f (3) := by sorry
  --  exact h₈
