In a sequential shooting scenario where two shooters A and B independently take turns, with A shooting first, if the probability of A hitting the target on any given shot is $p_A = 0.3$ and the probability of B hitting the target is $p_B = 0.4$, then the probability $P(A)$ that A is the first to hit the target is given by:

  $P(A) = \frac{p_A}{1 - (1-p_A)(1-p_B)} = \frac{15}{29}$
