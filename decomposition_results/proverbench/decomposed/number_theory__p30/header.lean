For a prime number `p=4k-1` where `k∈ℕ` and an integer `a` in which the congruence `x^2≡a` (mod `p`)
has a solution, the solutions are `x=±a^k`, as per Euler's criterion, which implies that if a solution
exists, then it is defined that `a^(2k-1)≡1` (mod `p`). As such, for `x=a^k`, it holds that
`x^2≡a^(2k)≡a` (mod `p`).
