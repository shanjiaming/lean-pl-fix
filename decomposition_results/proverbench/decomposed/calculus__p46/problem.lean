theorem integral_sqrt_x_minus_5 (x : ℝ) :

    -- The integral `∫ (x : ℝ), Real.sqrt (x - 5)` is not a real number, but a function space or something else.
    -- This leads to a contradiction because the statement is malformed.
    -- However, Lean does not allow us to directly derive `False` from this, so we use `sorry`.
