All zeros of the polynomial \(f(x)=x(x-2)(x-4)(x-6)+(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7)\) are real as
\(f(-\infty)=f(\infty)= +\infty\), \(f(1) <  0\), \(f(3) > 0\), \(f(5) <  0\),
indicating that polynomial \(f\) has a real zero in each of the intervals \((-\infty,1)\),
\((1,3)\), \((3,5)\), \((5,\infty)\), a total of four.
