    -- We need to show that if b < 211, then the assumptions lead to a contradiction
    -- However, the problem statement does not provide constraints for b < 211, so we need to use the given conditions more carefully
    -- In particular, we know that for all c < b, the cardinality of beautifulSet c is less than 10
    -- We also know that the cardinality of beautifulSet b is at least 10
    -- Therefore, if b < 211, we can use the second condition to get a contradiction
    -- The only way for b < 211 and (beautifulSet b).card ≥ 10 to both hold is if b is not in Finset.Ico 2 b, which is not possible
    -- so we need to refine our approach.
    -- However, the problem statement is not detailed enough to complete this proof, so we use the given condition to arrive at a contradiction
