theorem h₇ (f✝ f : ℕ → ℕ) (h_inj : ∀ (x y : ℕ), f x = f y → x = y) (h_def : f 1 = 2 ∧ ∀ n ≥ 2, f n = n + 2) (hf0 : f 0 = 3) (h2 : f 2 = 4) (h1 : f 1 = 2) (m n : ℕ) (h₃ : f m ≥ 2) (h₄ : f n ≥ 2) (h₅ : f m + f n ≥ 2) (h₆ : f (f m + f n) = f m + f n + 2) : f (f m) = f m + 2 := by
  have h₈ : f m ≥ 2 := by sorry
  have h₉ : ∀ k ≥ 2, f k = k + 2 := h_def.2
  have h₁₀ : f (f m) = f m + 2 := by sorry
