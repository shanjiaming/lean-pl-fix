  have h₃ : (∏ x in Finset.range n, a x : ℝ) ≤ 1 := by sorry
  have h₄ : (∏ x in Finset.range n, a x : ℝ) = (∏ x in Finset.range n, a x : ℝ) := rfl
  have h₅ : (∏ x in Finset.range n, a x : ℝ) = (∏ x in Finset.range n, (a x : ℝ)) := by sorry
  have h₆ : (∏ x in Finset.range n, a x : ℝ) ≤ 1 := by sorry
  have h₇ : (∏ x in Finset.range n, a x : NNReal) ≤ 1 := by sorry
