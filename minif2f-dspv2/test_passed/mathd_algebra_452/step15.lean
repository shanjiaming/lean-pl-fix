theorem h₁₀ (a : ℕ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ (n : ℕ), a (n + 2) - a (n + 1) = a (n + 1) - a n) (h₁ : a 1 = 2 / 3) (h₂ : a 9 = 4 / 5) (h₃ : a 2 - a 1 = a 1 - a 0) (h₄ : a 3 - a 2 = a 1 - a 0) (h₅ : a 4 - a 3 = a 1 - a 0) (h₆ : a 5 - a 4 = a 1 - a 0) (h₇ : a 6 - a 5 = a 1 - a 0) (h₈ : a 7 - a 6 = a 1 - a 0) (h₉ : a 8 - a 7 = a 1 - a 0) : a 9 - a 8 = a 1 - a 0 := by
  have h₁₀₁ := h₀ 7
  have h₁₀₂ := h₀ 6
  have h₁₀₃ := h₀ 5
  have h₁₀₄ := h₀ 4
  have h₁₀₅ := h₀ 3
  have h₁₀₆ := h₀ 2
  have h₁₀₇ := h₀ 1
  have h₁₀₈ := h₀ 0
  have h₁₀₉ : a 9 - a 8 = a 8 - a 7 := by sorry
