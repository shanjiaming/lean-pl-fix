theorem h₆₂ (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c) (h₁ : a + b + c = 2) (h₂ : a * b + b * c + c * a = 1) (h₃ : 0 ≤ a) (h₄ : 1 ≤ c) (h₅ : c ≤ 4 / 3) (h₆₁ : a + b = 2 - c) : a * b = (c - 1) ^ 2 := by
  have h₆₃ : a * b + b * c + c * a = 1 := h₂
  have h₆₄ : a + b + c = 2 := h₁
  have h₆₅ : a * b = 1 - c * (a + b) := by sorry
