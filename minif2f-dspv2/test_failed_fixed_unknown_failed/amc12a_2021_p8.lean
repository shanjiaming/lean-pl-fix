/-- A sequence of numbers is defined by $D_0=0,D_1=0,D_2=1$ and $D_n=D_{n-1}+D_{n-3}$ for $n\ge 3$. What are the parities (evenness or oddness) of the triple of numbers $(D_{2021},D_{2022},D_{2023})$, where $E$ denotes even and $O$ denotes odd?

$\textbf{(A) }(O,E,O) \qquad \textbf{(B) }(E,E,O) \qquad \textbf{(C) }(E,O,E) \qquad \textbf{(D) }(O,O,E) \qquad \textbf{(E) }(O,O,O)$ Show that it is \textbf{(C) }(E,O,E).-/
