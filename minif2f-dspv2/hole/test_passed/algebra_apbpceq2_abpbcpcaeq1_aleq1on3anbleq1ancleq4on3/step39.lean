theorem h₇ (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c) (h₁ : a + b + c = 2) (h₂ : a * b + b * c + c * a = 1) (h₃ : 0 ≤ a) (h₄ : 1 ≤ c) (h₅ : c ≤ 4 / 3) (h₆ : a ≤ 1 / 3) : 1 / 3 ≤ b := by
  have h₇₁ : a + b = 2 - c := by sorry
  have h₇₂ : c ≤ 4 / 3 := h₅
  have h₇₃ : 1 ≤ c := h₄
  have h₇₄ : a ≤ b := h₀.1
  have h₇₅ : 0 ≤ a := h₃
  have h₇₆ : 1 / 3 ≤ b := by sorry
  --  exact h₇₆
