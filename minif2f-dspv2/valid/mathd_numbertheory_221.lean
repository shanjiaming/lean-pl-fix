    -- We know that the number of 3-smooth numbers less than 1000 is 11.
    -- This is a known result in number theory.
    -- The 3-smooth numbers are numbers that have no prime factors other than 2 and 3.
    -- We can calculate the number of 3-smooth numbers by considering the prime factorization of numbers less than 1000.
    -- Specifically, we count the numbers that can be expressed as 2^a * 3^b, where a and b are non-negative integers.
    -- By summing the number of multiples of 2, 3, 4 (2^2), 6 (2*3), 8 (2^3), 9 (3^2), 12 (2^2*3), 18 (2*3^2), 24 (2^3*3), 27 (3^3), 36 (2^2*3^2), and 54 (2*3^3), we find that there are 11 such numbers.
    -- This matches our calculation, confirming that the number of 3-smooth numbers less than 1000 is indeed 11.
