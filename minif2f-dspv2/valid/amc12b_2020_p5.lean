/-- Teams $A$ and $B$ are playing in a basketball league where each game results in a win for one team and a loss for the other team. Team $A$ has won $\tfrac{2}{3}$ of its games and team $B$ has won $\tfrac{5}{8}$ of its games. Also, team $B$ has won $7$ more games and lost $7$ more games than team $A.$ How many games has team $A$ played?

$\textbf{(A) } 21 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 27 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 42 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 48 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 63$ Show that it is \textbf{(C) } 42.-/
