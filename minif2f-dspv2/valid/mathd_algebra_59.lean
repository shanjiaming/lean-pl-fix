    have h₃ : (4 : ℝ) ^ b = 4 := by
      -- We start by simplifying the given equation \( 4^b + 8 = 12 \).
      -- Given \( h₂ : 4^b + 8 = 12 \), we can rewrite it as:
      -- \[ 4^b + 2^3 = 12 \]
      -- Since \( 2^3 = 8 \), the equation becomes:
      -- \[ 4^b + 8 = 12 \]
      -- Subtract 8 from both sides:
      -- \[ 4^b = 12 - 8 \]
      -- Simplify the right side:
      -- \[ 4^b = 4 \]
      -- Thus, the solution for \( b \) is \( b = 1 \).
