  -- The steps involve verifying the divisibility and applying the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).
  -- We have:
  -- gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) | n + 7 and gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) | 2n + 1.
  -- Therefore, gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) | (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7).
  -- Simplifying: (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13.
  -- Since gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) | -13, and gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) | 13, we conclude that gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) is a divisor of 13.
  -- The divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. Hence, gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) | 13.
  -- Therefore, gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) ≤ 13.
