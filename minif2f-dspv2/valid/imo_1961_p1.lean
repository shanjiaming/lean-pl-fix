Solve the system of equations:

$
\begin{matrix}
\quad x + y + z \!\!\! &= a \; \, \\
x^2 +y^2+z^2 \!\!\! &=b^2 \\
\qquad \qquad xy \!\!\!  &= z^2
\end{matrix}

where $a $ and $b $ are constants.  Give the conditions that $a $ and $b $ must satisfy so that $x, y, z $ (the solutions of the system) are distinct positive numbers.-/
