/-- The sequence $S_1, S_2, S_3, \cdots, S_{10}$ has the property that every term beginning with the third is the sum of the previous two.  That is, $ S_n = S_{n-2} + S_{n-1} \text{ for } n \ge 3. $ Suppose that $S_9 = 110$ and $S_7 = 42$.  What is $S_4$?

$ \textbf{(A)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 6\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 10\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 12\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 16\qquad $ Show that it is \textbf{(C) }{10}.-/
