/-- Suppose that $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are three positive numbers that satisfy the equations $xyz = 1,$ $x + \frac {1}{z} = 5,$ and $y + \frac {1}{x} = 29.$ Then $z + \frac {1}{y} = \frac {m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are [[relatively prime]] positive integers. Find $m + n$.


note: this is the type of problem that makes you think symmetry, but actually can be solved easily with substitution, and other normal technniques Show that it is 005.-/
