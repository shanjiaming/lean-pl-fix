/-- Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers, and that the [[equation]] $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ has solutions $a$ and $b$. Then the pair $(a,b)$ is

$\mathrm{(A)}\ (-2,1)
\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ (-1,2)
\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ (1,-2)
\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ (2,-1)
\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ (4,4)$ Show that it is \mathrm{(C)}\ (1,-2).-/
